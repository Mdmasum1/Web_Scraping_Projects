Wow! It's so big! Where is the tanker heading? Because of the children, don't accelerate too much. Yes. Ah, it's cold. - Mutsumi! Go to where your father is. - I won't. It's okay. Let's go. - What is that? - I don't know. Mr. Hayami! Sorry for all the trouble today. We just came here to see the boats, but the kids wanted to board. No problem. I don't use my boat that much. - It doesn't matter. - You always help us with your donations. I don't know what to say to thank you. Please don't mention it. Thank you. Let's sing. Mutsumi! How is it? Are you having fun? I am! Okay, stop here! - Thank you for everything today. - Don't mention it. Okay, let's go. Mutsumi! Would you like to go home with papa? No! Minato Kindergarten Minato Kindergarten - Takashi! Hey! Be careful! -Yes! - Takashi! Hey! Be careful! - Yes! Restaurant 2F Yokohama Marina - Everyone, be careful! Bye! - Bye! Mutsumi! - I'm back! - Welcome back! Your clothes are a mess. What did you see? - What did you do today? - Kazuko! That sounds awesome! I offered her a ride, but she really wanted to go back by bus. I've asked you not to approach her. Mutsumi is not only yours. She is my precious, only daughter as well. I don't want to! Mutsumi! Mutsumi! Fucking Idiot! Thank you. No! No! No! Mutsumi! You are not supposed to run away like that! Thank you. You saved her. It's okay. She didn't get hurt. Please let me know how I can show my gratitude. No, it's okay. Give me your name at least. Good morning. Nakada from the Kukuei Clan is here. He is a bit different today. Headquarters of Hayami Company Inc. Isn't it too early to have our regular meeting? Or do you have some good news? The President recognizes that, in the current climate... our clan has to develop political connections more aggressively to survive. Nakada! Unlike the President, I'm not into political connections. Only national affairs matter to me! It's about how Japanese people live their lives! Mr. Hayami! I've shut my eyes to your business so far. However, from now on, I will follow the President's wishes. I'm taking these documents. Recently, the President has become suspicious of your business. It's possible that he might take your life. That's why I'm going to cut ties with you. Are you saying you're only concerned about your own future? Isn't that kind of selfish? Mr. Hayami! The President can do anything by moving his forces allover Yokohama. I've experienced that in person. Compared to us, the President is like the Emperor now. Nakada? If we leave Nakada be, he will come for our lives one day. But if he gets killed, the President will make a move. Who said that we'd kill him? Everybody dies eventually. It doesn't matter if it's a bit early. I don't think the President will be convinced by that. We can't take him on directly. I always knew it'd come to this. This is our best chance. Boss, please rethink this. Tamai... I've already bet my life on this. We force the President to retire or otherwise we kill him. I will assign this job to Kawashima's crew. Understood? The underground parking lot is this way. Hey! Listen. Hit his stomach. Don't kill him right away. - Make it look like an accident. - Yes. - He knows karate so be careful. - Yes. Okay, are you sure about donating this to the politicians? Yes, be careful. What an idiot. His pathetic move of changing sides will be his undoing. Sorry. Forgive us. Mr. Nakada! I'm sorry. I misunderstood the situation. What the hell is all this about? Hayami Company must be so over by doing this. Please. Hey! Did it go well? - Hey! Would you like to have some tea? - Okay. Welcome. I'm Hayami. We are just waitresses. Where is Kazuko? Mutsumi has a fever, so she is upstairs. Kazuko! Is she okay? She had a nightmare. That's all. Mama... I will do it myself. She is scared. If that woman hadn't saved her... I am thankful for what she did. I will find her one day and show her my gratitude. Please do but don't come near us. Kazuko. Stop this nonsense and come home with me. It's not just for you. Mutsumi is also at risk. I don't want to hear those kind of excuses. There is nothing more to be said. What are you not satisfied about? What are you complaining about? Yes. The Boss is coming. We will arrive in 10 minutes. Got it? Our real challenge has just begun. How will the President react? The stone has started rolling from the top of the hill. After that, we just go as far as we can. Good morning! Good morning! Please. - Follow her! - Boss! - There! - Don't lose her! Follow her! - Wait! - She turned right. Don't lose her! - She disappeared! - She must be close by! - Go that way! - Okay! Shit! Where did she go? Are you okay? There she is! Follow her! What a sneaky bitch! - Idiot! Where are you going! - Which way do you think it is? - I think that way. - Idiot! It's this way! That way! Hey! You're too slow. It's M. I have no doubt about it. M? I've heard the story from someone else. She's the best female assassin among the President's underlings. Her name starts with an M. She uses all kinds of weapons. Apparently, her specialties are narrow shurikens and Tarama-style karate. Tarama? It's a mysterious martial art originated from the Tarama Island in Okinawa. A fatal martial art that only targets the neck of the enemy. This is exactly what I expected from the President. He prepared this trick because he's been dealing with me for along time. I knew you'd come here. This spot is perfect for hiding and hearing sounds. Snakes know where snakes hide. Only a pro can deal with another pro. I didn't know I'd meet you at a place like this. I will enjoy you as much as I can before I kill you. You have such a gorgeous body. CEO's Office Mr. Kawashima! It's Tani! Inugami got killed. He was hit in the neck. - How about the killer? - She was very sneaky. We couldn't see her face! We've searched the harbor all over, but we couldn't find anything. Kawashima! What are you going to do? Since we have nothing, there is nothing much we can do. We have to lure her. That's the only way. But how? Using bait. The Boss becomes the bait. Hey! Bring it here! - Hey! - Yes. - Do it right. - Leave it to me. Here she comes. Finish it. I can't. The Boss is in the way. It's okay. Fire! Okay. Where did she go? Hey! Out of the way! Let's go home! Let's go home! You are not supposed to look at me. Go home! Mama! Mama! Kiyonaga Station Hey, Mister! Have you seen an injured woman around here? Focus! Tell me! That way! Keep drinking. Be careful, you're troubling pedestrians! Idiot! Whatever happens to her is not my business! Some of the beans are from Southeast Asia. Indonesia and Malaysia for example. That must be profitable. Excuse me. You are interrupting my business. I know very well that you don't like seeing me or the Boss here. I will leave in a bit. I just want to ask you to say something to the Boss. He doesn't listen to us, but he listens to you. That's why I am here. The Boss is playing a reckless game. If things go wrong, not only the Hayami Company will be finished... but the Boss' life will also be at risk. No, he will definitely die. It's not my business. Please go back! I want you to tell him to stop this dangerous game! You want to know why? The Boss' life is in danger. Please. - Why are you here? - I was just... You've been begging Kazuko, haven't you? I know what this is about. Boss! Please stop moving against the President! Inugami has already been killed! Tamai! Shut your big mouth! Are you okay? Don't make a scene in my bar! He came here to save your life. Tamai! Come on! Let's go! Wait in the car. How much? It's okay. Sorry for the scene. Let's go. Sorry. These kin of things are inevitable in my career. Please forgive me. Career? You only think of yourself. It feels like you step onto the tatami mat of my heart with your shoes still on. Enough is enough, Kazuko! That means... No way! Hayami... This is who I am. There is no other way of life for me! That's right. You're totally different from me. You raped me. And then Mutsumi was born. So what? Does that make me your property? Is Mutsumi your property? I don't think so! I am me, Mutsumi is Mutsumi. It's not your business! Kazuko! You came here to beat Mr. Tamai, didn't you? It's typical of you. Your business is over. Leave now. Since I'm already here, let me see Mutsumi. Just for a moment. Alright? Kazuko! What happened to you? Are you okay? Hang in there! You should go see a doctor! No... The Hayami Dojo is the embodiment of my spirit! How is it possible that one female assassin has beaten so many of my guys? Kawashima! The President clearly doesn't want me to stay alive. We have to conclude this battle! Am I right? Tsuruoka! Can you devote your life? I will do it! Yes! Listen! Watch the Okazaki area 24/7. Got it? We've searched most of the hospitals but... She's not at a hospital. She got shot. She's hiding somewhere. - Find her! - Yes! - Hey! - Good evening! Good evening! Sorry for the wait. The names are Akemi and Tamae. They are the two who have come to our shop throughout last week. Please! Hurry! Slow down! Are you injured or something? I have a scar from an appendix surgery. Do you want to see it? Idiot! I will contact Kawashima. I'll give you some love how. - Wow! I am happy! - You are cute! Please call him later. - Shut up! Wait for a sec! - We don't have much time... - Hurry! - Okay, whatever. I like you. Sorry for the trouble. Have you been awake? Thanks to you, my injury got better. Please make yourself comfortable. It's no trouble at all. Yes. Thank you. I will be back after cleaning downstairs. Boss! I didn't tell you this. I've sent a killer for the President. Mr. Tamai! It's okay. Once the President goes down, I will get a call. Mr. Kawashima, can I come in? Go ahead! An injured woman is wandering around. I think this might be a trap, though. It's M. No doubt about it. Right. - Bitch! - Leave me alone! - Grab her tight! - Show me! You're not supposed to do that! - Shut up, Bitch! - You must have a gunshot wound! You are mistaking me for someone else! - What? - Show me now! Don't move, Bitch! Let me go! I told you, you are wrong! What's your problem, Bitch! Just show me! Let me go! Not a chance! What is this? Take it off! Bitch! She's upstairs! She's moving! Go! Why did you shoot me? - Use the drum! - Yes. Mr. Kawashima is late. We just have to wait for the call that the President is dead! Welcome back. Sister! Let's go to the park! Mutsumi! She just came home. It's okay. Thank you. She is just so happy to see you again. Let's go! Please take care of her! I will be back! What? Where are you calling from? What do you mean by that? The closest place to me? You bitch... This is a pathetic trap! I won't go! Sister! Let's go for a swing! Mutsumi! Papa is coming. Did you call him? I will be a good girl. Boss! What was the call about? It was nothing. Leave me alone for a while. Boss! Where are you going? Stay put! Boss! Boss! Boss! Please wait! - Move! - Boss! Out of my way! Boss! Where are you going? Boss! Boss! It's okay. Leave him alone! But if we let him... If he gets killed, that's his own fault. He has no authority as a boss anymore. Where is Mutsumi? M? Where is M? Who? Mutsumi! Where is Mutsumi? She went to the park to play. If I don't go now, Mutsumi will be in danger. What do you mean? Mama! Get away from Mutsumi! Release the kid! Bitch! Do you consider yourself a proper Japanese person with that behavior? I knew you would definitely come. And on your own. Mutsumi! - Honey, what will happen to Mutsumi? - Don't worry. I have to tell you that the President will die soon. You won't have your owner anymore. Are you still going to be loyal to him? Killing is my business. I killed Kawashima as well. Now it's your turn. Stop! Honey! Stop! Stop! Mama! - Mutsumi! - I'm scared! Mutsumi! - It hurts! - Mutsumi! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! If only killing a person could solve everything... The relationship between Hayami and me would've been solved along time ago. Even this child... The mission has been accomplished. Yes. It's exactly as the report says. There is nothing more to report... The End
