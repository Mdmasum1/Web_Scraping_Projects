I think it'd be super interesting, and just for my following, you know? Like, I feel like it's gonna gain me probably like 50,000 extra followers. What do you guys think? Baby? - [Chad] Yes. - [Sarah] Pour the shots. - [Chad] Yes, ma'am. - Are you gonna tell us why we have our laptops? It's spring break. I don't wanna look at this. - Yeah, I'd actually like to know that too. - Okay, I'm gonna film my toast for TikTok, and, at the end, you all just follow my lead. We're gonna throw our laptops into the water at the end. - Wait, what? [Chad chuckles] - Yeah. - Wait, wait, wait, guys, guys, guys.

These belong to the school, and it's a complete environmental hazard. - [Pearce] Bro! - Think of your children's children! - Bro, stop being such a bitch. Just do it. Don't you wanna go viral? - Dog, you know Sarah's really trying to become an influencer, okay? Don't ruin her dreams, my guy. - Yeah, and the school's just gonna give us new ones anyway, and fuck that capitalist institution. - I'll need a refill here, Chad. - Whatever, Hope. - Chad!

We were gonna get married someday. - Uh, yeah. I'm really sorry, Sarah. - Yeah. Yeah. What the fuck are we gonna do? - I don't know. That thing didn't even look real. - Well, it is. You saw what it just did to Chad. [Sarah sobs] Sorry, Sarah. How the fuck are we gonna get outta here? - I don't know. - Sam! - I'm thinking. I'm thinking. What if we, like, distracted it with our food or something? - Do you think that thing's gonna want Gwyneth Paltrow's vegan tahini dip and some olives? - Yeah. Maybe. - Still alive. - What was that, Sarah? - Do you think he could still be alive, like Paisley? - Who? - Chad! - Um. - Uh. - Maybe. - [Hope and Sam] Yeah, yeah. - Probably. - [Hope] It's looking good. - Mhm. There's a big chance. Yeah. - [Hope] Yeah. [knocking at door] [ominous music] - Chad! Chad! [tense music] [Sarah yelps] - Paisley! - Christ! - Oh my God! - Holy fuck. I completely forgot about her. - Help! It's so big! [tense music] [alligator growls] - No, ew! Get off me! Get off me! [Paisley screams] Get off me! [Sarah and Paisley screaming] [ominous music] - What are you doing? - It's okay. [foreboding music] - Do you see it? [Sam sighs] - Oh, no, no. Wait, look, look, look. Look, over there. - [Sarah] No, no, no. [Sarah whimpers] - By the basketball hoop. - Oh, God. Oh, God. [Sarah panting] [foreboding music] - Oh my God. [ominous music] [alligator growling] [Paisley coughing] [Sarah panting] - Oh, God. Oh, God. It's gonna fucking eat her! - Okay. We need to distract it. - It's been kind of nice, just the two of us. I mean, what do we do? - The food. The food. We can distract it with the food. The, the, the- - The dip, the dip! - The dip shit that she likes to eat, that disgusting Gwyneth Paltrow. - Get it, get it, get it! - [Hope] LA shit she likes. Where the hell would you keep something like that? Oh, the fridge! - Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Okay, okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - What? - Are you sure? - Yes. We have to try something. Okay? - Okay, okay, okay. - Don't be a baby. Okay. Here we go. [tense music] Hey, asshole! Come get it! [alligator growls] Oh! Okay! [ominous music] [hoop rattles] - Oh my God, Pearce! Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew! [tense music] [ominous music] - Huh, shit. Gators like tahini dip. - [Hope] Oh, thank God. - Come on, come on, come on. - [Sarah] Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! - Yeah! - Come on, come on! Get in there! Get in the car! [Sarah screams] - úShit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Oh my God. Oh my God. - Oh, she made it! - Yes! - She made it! - Okay! [suspenseful music] - I think I insulted it with the dip. - Oh my God. Oh my God. The keys. [ominous music] - Oh. Oh, shit. - [Sam] Uh. - Oh my God. [Sarah yelps] [alligator growls] Shit. Oh my God, shit. Please don't kill me, Mr. Gator. I promise I'll return my gator handbag. [Sarah gasping] Okay, Sarah. You can do this. You can do this. [Sarah panting] [foreboding music] [alligator growls] [Sarah panting] [foreboding music continues] [alligator growls] [tense music] [Sarah screaming] - Oh, God! Help me move the couch. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Okay. [Sam grunts] You got it? - [Hope] Yeah. - Okay, okay. Now pull it. Okay. Okay. Is it bizarrely quiet? - Why isn't it trying to get in? - Maybe the dip killed it. - I can't fucking believe this is happening. - Better them than us, right? - Yeah. - Right? - Are you kidding me? - Shit, shit. [crickets chirping] [ominous music] [alligator growls] - I didn't even wanna fucking be here, okay? My mom guilt tripped me into coming so I could get to know Chad better. Why did I listen? I could be home. Instead, I am in the fucking redneck riviera, hiding from a man-eating gator! - I didn't even want to be here either. - At least they're your friends. Well, they were. - I mean, not really. Those guys are fucking assholes. I don't even like them, and they sound dumb as shit. - So why did you come? - I, uh... I heard you were coming. - But you didn't even know me. - Chad kinda showed me a picture of you, and I may have stalked your Instagram. - You did? - Yeah. I don't even know why I'm admitting this right now. It's probably 'cause we're both gonna die tonight, but yeah. - That's kind of creepy. - Sorry. - But cute. [gentle music] [alligator growls] [Sam gasps] - Oh, God. [crickets chirping] [foreboding music] [birds chirping] [ominous music] [alligator growls] [gentle music] [Sam gasps] [mysterious music] Hey. Wake up. - What, what, what, what, what? - We fell asleep. - Shit. - [Sam] Yeah. - I was hoping this was all just a nightmare. - Yeah, me too. - How long were we out? - A few hours or so. - Do you think it's still out there? I mean, maybe it gave up and it went away. - Maybe. [playful music] - Oh. I'll go check. - Yeah. Thank you. [foreboding music] - Okay. It's fine. [tense music] [Sam gasps] - What? [Sam screams] - [Sam] Holy shit! - So? - Yeah, so it was just right outside the window, waiting for us. - Fuck! - [Sam] Yeah. - And Sarah, I mean, is she- - Dead, arm severed, keys in her hand. I think we're fucked. - Well, what is it doing? - Oh, you know, it's like regular alligator stuff, just floating through the air, circling the corpse of our best friend. - Did you see anyone else out there? - No, no. I'm pretty sure it ate them all. - Fuck! - Yeah. - The keys. - What? - The keys. You said the keys are still in Sarah's hand. - Yeah. Her bloody, disgusting, severed hand. - Okay, okay, so then what if we distract it? - We give it her other hand! - No. We lead it outside and then we make a break for it and we grab the keys and we just get the fuck out of here. - No, no, no, no, no. That didn't work. We already tried that. Remember, with the vegan Goop tahini dip? He doesn't want that. He's too smart for it. He wants us. He wants meat. - Okay, well, we have to try something, or else we're gonna end up like them. - I like my hands. I want two hands. - I know, so I need you to think. - The Bluetooth speaker! - What? - Get the speaker. - [Hope] Okay. - What if we somehow connect our phone and play some loud-ass song and we throw it out this door? The gator thinks it's us. Distracts it long enough for us to get to the car. - Holy shit. That might actually work. You're a genius. I love you. Okay, okay, okay. God, these fucking things. - [Speaker] Connecting to King Chad the Sex God iPhone. - It's still connected to his phone! - Hurry up! - Okay, okay, okay. - [Speaker] Disconnecting King Chad the Sex God iPhone. - Oh, yeah, nice. [suspenseful music] - Hurry! - [Hope] Okay, okay, okay. - [Speaker] Connecting to Hope iPhone. - Oh, oh, oh. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Are you ready? Are you ready? - No, no, no. Get it, get it, get it. - Okay, okay, okay. Shit, the speaker. I got it, I got it, I got it. Are you ready? - [Sam] Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. - Wait. [tender music] - What was that for? - That's in case you get eaten alive. Oh! - That's for good luck. I've never kissed anyone before. - Oh! Oh. Okay. - Let's do it. - Right!

[Sam gasps] [tense music] [alligator growls] [Hope screams] [tense music] - [Speaker] Battery at 3%. Reducing volume. [tense music continues] - Wait. He stopped. He's giving up. - What? - Look! - [Speaker] Battery at 1%. Powering down. - What the hell am I even looking at? - It shrunk. Oh my God. [Sam chuckles] - I can't believe it! - How is that even possible? - Who cares? We did it. We really fucking did it! [Sam and Hope chuckle] - Mwah. - What was that one for? - That's a taste of what's gonna happen later. - [Sam] I like the sound of that. - [Hope] Yeah! Woo! [playful music] [peaceful music] Sam? - [Sam] Yeah? - [Hope] That's not my hand. - [Sam] Oh, fuck! [foreboding music] [alligator growls] [tense music] [tense music continues] [tense music continues]
