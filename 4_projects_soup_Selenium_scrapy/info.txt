option.

But it is haarder to learn than selenium or BeautifulSoup.

---Srapy is fast , this is one of the biggest advantages
---Since it is ascyncronus , and for its scrapy spider 
you do not have to wait for making request one at a time.

---But it can be request in parallel.This increses efficiency
which make scrapy, memory and cpu efficiency.
---This is most complete framwork with it you can easily store 
data into databases , create crawler and do more with 
Scrapy.
