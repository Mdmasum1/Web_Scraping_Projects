I have the... please... What are you doing? There's no use in memorizing something like that. That's information. - You need to learn what you can do with it. The english language, love...

Try to interpret the information in the right way. It's all about timing. Shut the fuck up man! Can I have it please? - Not in japanese, you fool. In english man, english! Information remember, information! - Can I have it...please? Tell them what you mean with "it" - Can I have the money please? Shinichi, 20 years old... quit school early. He thought to himself: I'm in New York! I'm running in the streets of New York! I've always dreamt of this. I've just robbed a store. And I'm on the run with the loot in my hands. And when he closes his eyes... he keeps seeing the runway in front of him. faster...faster...faster Shin! Shin! Wow! I'm in New York. New York is hazardous? Wow, awesome! Are you japanese? Where are you from? She said she's never heard such broken english before. What are you doing? Leave me alone will you. Even now noone knows where he really wanted to go to. Only he knows it. Hazard. That's where I want to go. Take me there. You go fuck you! What the fuck man. Weakling. Weakling. Look at you, weakling. Shinichi was thinking of going back to Japan. Shinichi, 20 years old. Last week he was still in school. He felt like he didn't belong there. Can you throw the ball back please. Here it comes! Thank you. Sorry I'm a little bit late. Shin? Shin! Wait up. What's going on? Shin... Look, we can go to Angkor Wat for only 78.000 yen, that's a great deal. Let's do that when we're on vacation. Japan makes you sleepy. But also restless. "DANGEROUS DESTINATIONS" New York... One of the cities with the highest crimerate in the world. Shin, isn't this what our english teacher was talking about. Last year the number of victims of the japanese maffia rose... ...to a record of 800, only in New York. Shin was getting sleepy and restless at the same time in Japan. He would do anything to get away. Don't you have any money? How old are you? - 20 Just like me! - Are you in college? I just quit. - Good on you man. This is Lee, I'm Takeda. Are you hungry? What do you think about this? It's crazy, right? You can stay at my place if you like. Don't mind him. I'll drive This man is Lee. Noone really knows much about him. But in the 90's everybody in the underground scene had heard his name once. At that time he often walked around half naked on Time's Square... ... and bothered people passing him. He had a lot of fun doing it. He'd bump into people and say it was some sort of poetry. "Life is poetry." he'd always say. He was in charge of an icecream factory. Atleast... that's what it looked like. What's your name again? - Shinichi Shin... Have you ever been in love? Are you tired? I've got a bed for you. Here's your bed, relax, lie down. You like movies? I've got loads of movies. This couch is the best. And here... are you hungry? Take a shower if you like. Do what you want, we've got to go for a while. We need to take care of something. Mr. Lee, dit moet u echt proberen. What the hell is this? Feathers everywhere... He's landed. It's so small from here. How long do you think you'll be gone? Shin, did you hear me? It's so fast... Can you answer me? Japan makes me so sleepy. What do you mean? Sleepy but restless... Hazard fascinates as a blue ocean, seen from a cliff. It...is...our...destiny... to...cultivate...our...loneliness... cultivate... Shin! Are you studying again? It's time for some practical experience. - What do you mean? Oh, lots of things. Lee, where did you learn japanese? I'm half japanese... Wait a second. Marking my territory. Lee, check this out. - Not again, come on. I took a picture of her, by the restaurant. Why don't you propose to her man. She doesn't even know me man, I'll have to go out with her first. I marked my territory. The city is now mine! Laat ons eens even rijden. Gaan jullie maar lopen. Won't we get into trouble for this? No man, this is what we do. This is our life, our simple life. Why did you come to America? The land of opportunities, right? Isn't there such a saying in japanese? That's right, something with a flower... All ways lead to Rome. All ways lead to Hazard. This is how we live. Come on I'm hungry. Aren't you coming? No, I'll wait here. Step by step, day by day... So that's Hazard... Shin, give me a hand. Lee, can I talk to you for a second. - Shin, talk to him will you? I'm fed up with it. - Shin, listen. At the restaurant in Bedford? there is this waitress... She's so hot man! He does that every time. How should I got at it? Just tell her you like her! If I did that, I wouldn't have this problem! Try some of this, it'll calm you down. This is just ice. What is that? That's our special icecream. This is what we sell. - And it's good stuff. What is it then? - Speedball ice. You want to try some? I'm in love. Nobody knows when Takeda came to America. Did you see who shot first? Did Takeda shoot them both? That was certainly what he wanted everyone to believe. You should read this. Walt Whitman, one of my favourite writers. I sit and look out upon all the sorrow... Yes, the sorrow. All the sorrow in the world. Oppression, that means getting screwed over by the gouvernment. Ja, shame... scandal. That's life you know? The sorrow and the oppression. Sobs, you know? Crying. So he can hear the young men crying. He can hear their pain. He can hear their tears. It means you feel bad for doing something. - Regret? So he regrets certain things he has done. Read the whole part again. Yo Shin, do you have any brothers or sisters? I do, I have an identical twin brother. Identical? We look the same on the outside. But we're totally different on the inside. He's a coward, afraid to live. Just kidding. What, you were joking? - Yes... Shin, you do it. What's that troubled look on your face for. You look so troubled. That's some good shit man. Was that really speedball? Your english has gotten a lot better huh. Come lick my icecream. Come suck on it. Lick it, suck on it. Come and suck on it. Takeda, come sit here with us. No thanks, I want to be loyal to my girlfriend. Come on Takeda. She's not even your girlfriend. Shin, take a look man. It's raining. Shin, we're going to the love-room. Takeda, come. - You guys go, I'll wait in the car. I cant say that. Maybe I should say it in japanese. Will you marry me? What are you looking at? Can I kiss you? You're from Japan right? Do you think you'll ever want to go back? - No, not really. What will you do? - Maybe I'll marry an american and get a greencard. What about you? What's your name anyway? Shin... Shinichi. Shin, sounds like sin... My name is Misa. Don't forget it okay. Shin, do you know what we're missing? - No. Enemies man... You were talking about it yesterday... remember? What did I say? Here, take this. This isn't just a movie! Long Riders is the best movie! What are we going to do anyway? - What? What's wrong with you? We're doing this for you. - What do you mean? Did you forget what you were talking about yesterday? What did I say? I can't believe this. You asked us if we had everything we wanted to have. Then you said that we didn't have any enemies. So we should go out and make some. And I think you're completely right. Did I say all that? - I can't believe this man. You say something smart and you forget about it right after. We're gonna kill them! I was completely smashed, I really can't remember what I said. You were right! Take out your gun. Point it to the front. Hold on Lee. What the fuck is going on. Just see it as an excursion. And I'm your guide. Hey Shin, this is my boss. He's okay. And this is a friend of my boss. And these are my brothers. And this guy is cool too, he's gonna make it bigtime. Let's propose a toast! Cheers! Shin, I'll probably go to Tokyo soon. You can help him out there huh Shin. - What are you guys talking about? He's my friend, one of my best friends. That was just a joke back there. Those were just blanks. There weren't any bullets in your gun. You tricked me. - You told us yourself you wanted enemies. We don't want to have any enemies at all. Just friends. Enemies you'll make. If you want them or not. That's how it is. I'd never say anything like that... Listen, the same thing happened to me once. They played that joke on me too. It's like a pledge. You've become a member of our crew. I hope you'll take care of me when I'm in Tokyo. Can I join you? What's this? Put your hand in front of it. Shin. Have you ever shot anyone? I have. Some asshole with a big mouth. It felt great. When you really hate someone, you should just shoot him. What are you doing? It's cute. That was Shins first encounter with a police officer, an officer named Mike. I'm dying of hunger, Takeda. I can't believe it. You give him something and he's not happy. When I look at this penny I don't see one penny. I see a million. Takeda, leave it to me. The sauce is amazing. Listen, I dreamt two nights in a row of Nancy. In the first dream I kissed her. And in the second we were married. - Really? Wait, there's more, we had 3 kids! - 3 kids? Nancy! It's always the same with you. This has been going on for too long. - Yeah, you have to talk to her. I'll put this here, okay? What are you looking at? Is your girl down there? It's Mike. Are you staring at her again? - She's so good looking. Isn't she a bit too young. - No way man! It's too expensive for a white hoohaa like you. We hare here to exchange one cent for one cent. Silence please, thank you ladies and gentlemen. All your jewelries, all your wallets, everything worth anything we're taking with us. Allright, just be good. Can you guys see this one cent here. We're going to make a million of it. Lee. Catch this invisible coin. We're taking over the entire world. We're going to rule the world, like the white man rules this island. Land of opportunities. We are here! Rome wasn't build in a day. To our roman empire. Tokyo... how would things be going in Tokyo? Safe Japan. Claustrophobic Japan. All these aspects make Japan what it is. Sleepy but restless. No matter what island you end up on, it becomes your home. That's right Shin. We were all floating on the ocean. Floating... And we accidentally ended up here. We are all japanese-americans. Yes, japanese-americans! Shin was always a dreamer. It sometimes felt as if the runway was going backwards below him. He always wanted to fly. But he had no wings. He kept on running on that runway. But it always remained a dream. But Shin hoped he could do it, with the three of them. To be able to fly together. I love you. Will you marry me? I'll come no matter what. Just take your money and fuck off! Hey Shin. Hurry up. - I'm almost ready. Hey, big boy huh. Hurry up will you. Takeda's going to ask Nancy to marry him. And we're going to be late. You japanese with your extreme healthcare. Takeda, you're going to tell her right? Takeda, it's finally going to happen man. Poodle... Poodle... Is he really going to say he loves her. Shin, Wong, I'll see you guys there okay? Okay, let's go. Shin. - Allright, I'm ready! What's up with the gun? What's going on? Calm down, take it easy. Listen to me, stay here. You fucking shot me in the ass man! Listen to me! Take it easy man. We'll see each other in Tokyo okay? Lee told me we'd meet again. But what was Shin supposed to do now? He was on his own again. Your english really got better. I need your help. Looks good on me huh? It feels good too, you know. I think it's a great jacket. When I fist saw you, you were wearing a Hazard t-shirt. Orange looks good on you. You think? I fucked up. I'm hanging in there. Ofcourse. Do you remember... ...when I threw you that coin, in the jazzclub? I'm getting you out of here. I need that coin for that. Can I borrow it? I'm going to use this penny to get you out of here. First I'm going back to Japan. When I get back, I'll get you out of here. I'm going to create a paradise for us in Japan. Like you did for me here, in America. Wait for me. Was that you Shin? Passport please. Where have you been? - San Francisco. What was the weather like? - Fine. Anything you would like to hand in? - No nothing. Okay, there you go. Excuse me. - No problem. Any luggage? No, just me. Can you empty your pockets please. I have a lot of money in my pockets. Take everything out please. That's all I have. Nothing else you can see anyway. This is worth a fortune, you see. I have more money here than you'll ever earn in your entire lifetime. You see? Can I have my passport please? Who's that? Hey, where are you going? Look, the sky is so blue. What the fuck are you doing there? What do you want? Fuck, he smells like shit. Look at that, nice haircut you have. Keep your hands off me. I'm warning you. Hey, let go man. Watch out boy, I'll kill you. Oh really? Show me something interesting. Before Shinichi knew it everything had gone by. It's been such a long time... ...the story of the boy who only wanted to fly.
