Don't worry, we are gonna enjoy plenty of tacos, chilaquiles and tortillas. Um... ahem. What's going on? Um, okay, uh... Ahem, Mom, Dad, this is my boyfriend, Leif. Leif, Mom and Dad. - Your boyfriend? - Mm... ¿Un gringo? Hey, how are you, Sr. Sanchez? What did he say? - It's... - He meant to say hello. No, no. That's fine, I just wanna hear it from him. Mr. Sanchez, it's a pleasure to meet you. Pleasure to make your acquaintance. - That's it! - What did he say his name was? - Leif. Mucho gusto. - What's that mean? I'm Gabbie, Claudita's mom. Nice to meet you, and this is Carmencita, y la abuela Tita. - Welcome, Leif! - Thank you! - Welcome to the family, huerito. - Ay! Welcome to the family. Mr. Sanchez, thank you so much. I am so excited. I've never been in a Mexican home before. - This is crazy! A Mexican's home. "A Mexican home." Okay. Okay. Family meeting in the Mexican home right now! - Ooh! I mean, "a Mexican home." What did he say, did you hear? What does he think? We sleep on chile? Darn it! - That fool is mad-mad! - Last time I saw him that mad was when I took his lawnmower, dog. Got the white boy in the back. Look at him. He's looking at us. Not even her type, dog. Thought she was into cholos. I don't like the way that fool looked at me, dog. So, you wanna go bang, ese? - I'm ready, fool. - Come on, man. Let's go jump him in. I'm serious. Think he has money? Did you know about this? Did you know? No, I didn't know anything. We didn't know anything! You kept the secret very well! - Since when? - Shh, he's gorgeous. - You see? - How come you didn't tell me? I... uh... I wa... I wanted it to be a surprise. Yeah, that wasn't a surprise. That was an ambush. You think we were surprised when the Americans went and invaded Mexico? And afterwards all the Mexicans are hanging out, "Mira nomás, wow, what a surprise!" Benicio, please stop! - You're overreacting like a little bit. - Don't worry. Bring it down a notch! He's listening! Don't be rude to him. Hey, hey, he was rude to me first. I wanted a Brown Christmas, not a White Christmas. Okay? I wanted a traditional Christmas, con las abuelas, los tíos, las tías, tamales, and all your cousins playing in the street, hurting themselves, así, a Mexican Christmas. How about you just... you give him a chance before you start judging him, okay? Give me a chance. He is like a cannellini bean, among the black beans. What's un chance? Is that his dad's name? Next thing you know, we'll be carrying water como pendejos. What time does the movie start? Jeez! What a temper! Hey, nothing that a tequila can't fix. - Leaf. - It's Leif. Uh, yes, yeah, I know. Make yourself at home, hmm? Mrs. Sanchez, I know this is a surprise. - See, Mr. Sanchez, he called Claudia... - Yeah. Invited her home for Christmas. - That's the only... - Yeah. No, no, no, don't worry. You don't have to explain yourself. The most important thing is that you're both here. I just wanted to surprise him. Well, you did surprise him, m'hijita, you did. You even surprised la Tootsie aquí. You even surprised me. Why are you keeping secrets like that, huh? - Baby, come on. - Have a seat, Leaf. - Uh, it's Leif. Yes, I know! What an ugly name! - Stop. - Gracias. Have a seat. What? It's true! He's so sweet. - He looks like a good guy! Right? - Yes, I know. Okay. I have to have a serious talk with Dad. And I have a date with a chela. Chela? Uh, Coachella? Ah [coos]... A chela. What do you want to drink? What do you want to drink, eh? What about a Mexican candy? Gracias. Guys... it's gonna be okay. - Yeah. Hey, is that fool checking me out or what? - What's up, ese? What's up? - Mm. Tito. I feel like I'm starting the next Mexican American war here. I'm sorry, babe. I... I'm sorry! - Oh. I'm surprised my crib still isn't in here. You know, Claudia, if this is gonna be an issue with your family, I feel like I should probably just go. - What? No. - Yeah. Come here. Come here. It's not my family. It's my father. He just needs to get to know you in the same way that I know you. I love you. - I love you, too. - Ay, ay, ay! Oh, my God! I think I strained... I think I strained my back. Ah! I go get the Vicks. It's good for broken backs. Okay, you breathe... y ahí vas. You breathe... No, espérate. - Ay, ay, ay... Wow, what happened to you?! How did you get tangled up like this? Don't be a jerk. Don't film this. - Talk to the camera, sis! - Stop, Carmen. Heal, heal, little frog's tail! - Is that better? - No, no, no, no. You have to breathe it in. - A ver, a ver, how about now? - Sí. Uh-huh. It's not helping. Maybe the smell helps you. I have to check the expiration date. Damn! Son of a gun! - Hey! Mamá! You okay? You okay? - No, no, no. Sí, sí. What happened?! Are you okay?! - Slow down. Okay, okay, okay. - It's nothing, baby. - How can I help you, Mom? - It's nothing, baby. - Relax, slow down... - Calm down, everyone! I'm fine! Slow down... - Hey, just... - Remember the yoga? - I do. - Don't break... don't, uh... - I know what I'm doing, - Baby, be careful, please. Okay? - Deep breaths, please. - Okay. Sí. No, you're not gonna crack me. I have kidney stone. Don't crack me. - I got this. - Be careful, baby, please, - We're gonna move you this way, okay? - Okay. A ver. - Let's go slowly. - Baby, be careful. - And she's doing so good. - A ver... ay... - Just breathe... - What the... - ¿Qué pasa? No, no... - What the... Ay, ¿que pasó? Dad! - What is this? - Okay, he was just helping... Oh my God, he was just helping Mom with... with... with an injury from yoga. Don't you think you're overreacting a little bit? Is it because he's White? Dad... since when do we judge people by the color of their skin? Hey, this isn't about the color of his skin or the lack of color of his skin. All right? I like gringos. All right? Because of them, we have this amazing house in this great country. We have food on our table. I mean, I love their food. Pizza and hot dogs. I mean, there's no taste, like eating cardboard. Hey, Dad! What's going on? Stop. How about, in front of all these witnesses, you make a promise... that you're gonna give him a chance? Just get to know him. Yeah, of course. - Ay. Hey. Are you feeling better? You need to apologize to Leaf. Leif. Yes! Whatever his name is. He is a good boy. You know, he actually fixed my back. Look, look! He used to work con los estos... With these guys from NY! The chiro... practicians. Anyway, I feel better. Well, I didn't know. Y so maybe your handyboy can help us with this aqui. Hmm? - What? What is that? - What do you think? - It's how they did it in Mexico. - It's a Christmas tree? A cactus? Yeah! Benicio, really? Listen, does nobody care about tradition around here except me? It's Christmas Eve. You know where they're at? They are there on Christmas Eve, eating tofu, con ese gringo. That's why Chicanos are losing their roots. First, we lost California, and then Arizona, and then Texas, and then New Mexico. New Mexico, they don't even consider themselves Mexicans. They consider themselves New Mexicans. How could you be a New Mexican? You know how? Because all old Mexicans are dying and the new ones are coming over, and where are they Christmas Eve? Eating tofu con un gringo! That's why! Okay. It is pretty. Am I doing everything wrong? No! It's pretty! Look at the little bow! So pretty. Pero you're changing the subject. You're gonna go and apologize to Leaf. - Leif. - Yes, that one. Hey, vatos. Ch-ch-ch-ch-check it out. I think he-he... he's mad at something. Yeah, the foreigner. Say what, fool? You're from Puerto Rico. I'm mad at your mom for having you. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me school you real quick, ese. That is US territory, homie. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. - No, it's not, fool. - Yes, it is. Hey, you put pineapple on your pizza? Oh, yeah. I love piña. You see? That's where you're confused. And soon your ass is gonna be singing country music in Spanish at a rap concert. - What's that mean, ese? Says a jealous German-looking Mexican. Hey, what's up, dude? - What's up, homie? - Hey, don't be judging no book by the color of the sleeve, homie. - All right, what? Sleeve? These are sleeves. - Right here, homie. - That's a highlighter. Yeah, I could tat you up real quick, homie. Look, boom, tatted. What's up, Highlights? - Hey, don't panic, fool. - I'm Hispanic. - I guess he's organic. Hey, forget you fools. Put the music back on. - Señor Sanchez! - Ay, my eyes! Hey, give me the bull. Ahí te va el bull. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Ahí te va el bull. - Don't get too close. Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out. Damn lights! Ahem. You okay? - I got you. - I want to say something... say something to you. Uh, sí, señor Sanchez? - Can you do me a favor? - Sí. - Can you stop calling me that? - What? Señor Sanchez. You know what? Just call me Bennie instead. Sure thing. Yeah. Hey, so, Leif, I wanted to, uh, I wanted to apologize to you for earlier today. I mean, I... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr... Señor... Mr. Bennie, - it's really... it's... it... - No. No, man, listen, I... I mean, I thought, you know... you looked like... Aww, crap. What the hell is this? Look at this bush! What a mess! - Oh, here... Here, I'll just... No, it's all messed up. You know, I could, uh... I could help you with that. Really? I know my way around a hedge. Yeah. - Really, huh? - Yeah. All right, don't go nowhere. Hang on. White boy is risking his huevos, eh? - Ah. Let's see. - Yeah. - All right. Good luck. Ahem. - Okay. Uh... All right. Damn. Damn, homie! I ain't never seen anything like this in my life. Wow! White boy gets down, eh? - Bring it in. - Oh, yeah. Let's go. Hey, he's a damn fool, ese. Palabra. Wow. Yeah, I think I know why that homegirl - fell in love with him, eh? - Mr. Bennie. Grass, homie. - Thank you. Yeah, here you go. Any time. Did that White boy just teach that Mexican how to landscape? Look, Bennie's speechless. Hey, fools, and what's next? They gonna valet park our lowriders, ¿o qué? Hey, he better be careful with this thing, fool. - Palabra. - He ain't touching my car, fool. What do you think? Um, I mean, I like all of it, except for the flags. - What... - What's wrong with the flag? Dad, it's Christmas, not Cinco de Mayo. Red, white and green. Jesus was Mexican. What? I never told you? His real name is Jesús, right? - Ay... - He'd ride around on a mule, lived at home until he was 33. - Mm-hmm. - Swears his mom was a virgin. Your tía Concha, she has seven kids and she swears that she's a virgin. Now, either she's lying or one of those kids is a Messiah. Okay, Dad, I love him. And your tío Gustavo, when he was locked up in county, said he found Jesus there. - Everybody loves Jesus. - Dad! I am trying to explain something to you here so we can have a real talk, but you're not really listening to me. Is there a way that we can meet in the middle? We need to have a talk, you and I. Wh... Do you see this? You're not even paying attention to me. Father-daughter talk. Dad, what father-daughter talk? When people talk to each other, they also listen to what the other has to say. That's what a talk is. Father-daughter talk. Come on. - ¿Qué? - Let's go. - Dad... Dad! Dad, my heels! Dad... Are you not gonna get my door? Uh, okay. Wow you changed. Cómo que change! See, in New York City, there's gentlemen. - Wow. - Gracias. All right, after you. This is fun. Okay, you know what, Dad? I wanna go home. Go... no! W-we... we just got here. What... this is your favorite place. What? No, it's not and it never was. Cómo que never was? What... what is this? Dad, I'm hungry. I want actual food. I¡Ay, qué rico! Where's he? Hola. Hola, Leaf. Hi, Leaf, come here and dance with your tía. There you go. Oh, no, no, not like that. - No? - Oh, no. Feel the music. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, come here. Party pooper. Vente, Leif, don't listen to her. No, she's okay. She's the non-recovered party girl of the house. - Ay, so yeah... - Wow. Have you tried the tamales? - Yes, yes, I have. They're great. - Yeah? Uh-huh. Although I don't find many places that make them back east. Yeah, uh, you're in for a treat this year, porque la Grandma Tita here, she's making her world famous, one-of-a-kind chicken tamales. - Uh-huh, oh yeah. Yeah. - Oh. You'll know what's good. - That sounds great. - Yeah. Dad, how come you never liked any of my boyfriends? You didn't even like Gabriel, and he was actually a good guy, and he came from a good family. Wait, well, who's that? Elmo? Elmo? The wetback! Dad! He was not a wetback and you called Immigration on him. Don't exaggerate, all right? All I did was yell "La migra!" and that kid took off. Hey, he ran across country so fast, if they had a border Olympics, he would've won gold. Papá, that's not funny. Mira, Joaquin, Frankie, Antonio. It's like I could never have a boyfriend because you would always just make it so hard for me. What the hell is it with this chicken? Hey, well, you... Thank you. Back to the... back to that cage. Um, you were too young to have boyfriends. Why, what now? What's your excuse now? Well, at least they're Mexicans. What about Javier? I know he's a little bit of a playboy, a little Don Juan thing going, but you know what, he's always been really nice to you. I am a strong, independent woman who is capable of making her own choices. You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about, because you're getting to the age that... where... Have you and Leif... I can't even believe I'm gonna say this... Mm. Has he taken your chanclas off? I¡Papá! Have you lost your mind?! I am 23 years old. I did not come here for you to tell me what it's like to be sin chanclas. That's going too far. - Look...! No, no, no, no, no! Look! You stupid chicken!! Mira, well... Hey, I've known you your whole life. He's known you two months. He's like a duck without legs! Hey, beautiful. - Javier? De la Torre? Would you look who it is? - Mm-mm. - Hi. Oh! - How are you? Your mom told me you were coming home for Christmas. I just did not think your dad would bring you back to this place on your first day back. Yeah, you and me both. And he thinks I'm the one who still hasn't grown up. Can you believe that? I mean, you look pretty grown to me. So what do you think of my girl? Wow, she is really pretty. Not as pretty as you. Ay. So, where can I take you? As far away from here as possible. Your wish is my command. - Hm. - After you. - Gracias. - Mm-hmm. Let's get some tacos de asada, yeah? Sí. Can't I do anything to help out? I feel like I'm just sort of, uh, standing around. - No. - You are just standing around. Get to work. - Sí, señorito. A. Señorita. Oh, that's right. Uh, a, girls, o is for boys. - Sí. - Señorita. Señorita. Disculpe. You are disculpado. Hm. Now, everybody in this family helps out with the cooking. I used to be a chef in Mexico. Mm, and a very good one. Mm-hmm. Wow, now I really can't wait to try your world-famous chicken tamales. You have to start with fresh, m'hijo. That's the secret. Now, Leaf, go into the kitchen and get the chicken out of the stove, please. - Sí, señorita. Dance with me! Damn chicken! Tita! At least pluck the chicken! Where's the chicken? Thank you! - Are you gonna close the door? You're stupid. Hi, baby. Hi. Hey. You must be Leaf. - I... - You're a lucky man, bro. This is Javier. I just told him everything about you. I'm sure you did. He's just an old friend. By old friend, you mean friend or friend-friend? - Hmm? - Have you ever seen Claudia dance salsa? - No. - Ay, stop it. My friend, you are missing out. Stop it. There's goes that F word again. Don't worry, huerito. She'll show you. I'll see you around. It was nice to meet you... - Twig? - Epa, Leif, I told you. Bye, beautiful. - Drive safe, okay? - Always, love. Sounds good, big kiss. See you later! Is there something I should know about? Because if I don't know, I don't know, but if I know... Yeah. Actually, there is. I knew it. Damn, he's handsome. - And he can dance, too? - What? No, no. - He's just an old friend. - How long have you known him? He's just an old friend. I told you. My Dad, he took me to that cheese place. Where is your dad? Probably still playing at Cheesy Chuck. It's because of me, isn't it? Um, yeah, of course it is. You know, at first, I didn't think this was such a huge mistake, but now I'm really starting to think it is. You know, I'm sorry I don't speak Spanish - or know how to salsa. You know, your dad would probably be more happy if you were with that Javier guy instead of me. Ay, ay, ay. Es que you men are impossible. Between trying to please you and please my father, I just feel like I can't win, so why do I even try? - I just... - Where are you going? I-I don't know. I don't know. Wait! Honey. That was so sweet! - What? - i¡Cariño! I've never heard you say that before. Well, I mean, maybe I could say something right, you know. Well, yeah, for once. - Aw. They're... they're watching. You should teach me how to salsa. Oh, you want me to teach you how to salsa? You're gonna start with your feet like this, eh? Okay, you know what? Forget about your feet. - Like this? - Let's work on the hips. - Okay. Like this? - Okay, a little bit. Just... Forget about your feet. Let's work on the hips. - Okay. - Okay. Uh-huh. A little bit of hips. - I like that. - Okay, hold my hand, baby. - Like this? No, my love, move your hips. - How about this? - Okay, forget about the hips. How 'bout you just twirl me and then you dip me, okay? Okay. Okay. - Do what? Wait, wait. - Twirl and then d... - Baby! - Um, I'm okay! - Seriously? - What are you guys doing? - I... Oh, God, how long... - Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I... how long have you been standing there? When did you get home? Long enough to see Mr. Leif doesn't know what he's doing. We were just... we were just having fun, Dad. We were just dancing. Dancing. Where I come from, you see a guy moving like that, you call him a pinguino. - Let me show you how it's done. - Here we go. - Here, give a little spin here, comes back. - Mm-hmm. When you get more advanced, you can spin her again. She comes to you, hi, and she comes back. Así, just like that. Beautiful. - All right, now it's your turn. - All right. Okay. No, no, not with her. With me. - What? - Come on. Yeah, come on. Hey. You have to feel it, all right, pinguino? Right here. You have to feel it. Do you feel it? - No. - Then you do a nice little turn - and come back. Okay. A bailar! - It's all about confidence, okay? - Okay. All right, I got you right here. - Okay. - Nice and ea... Ah! - Ah! Then I go into a bridge. And tight, tight, tight. Squeeze your glutes. - Smile. - Oh. - Damn! What happened? I was at Cluck-Y-Cheese with Claudia to have a father-daughter talk. She hates that place. Why does everybody say that? Bueno, y how was it? - What do you think? Now I know where the brown eggs come from. Entonces what happened? We got in a little argument. Where is she now? Now, she's outside dancing salsa con el gringo. Oh, well, that's good. That's great. Yeah. Okay. Ay... And all I wanted was to have a perfect Christmas. - Ow, ow... Stupid chicken. - Okay, baby, so my Aunt Carmen is in the guest bedroom, but make sure that you don't go in there, because otherwise you'll be dancing to cumbias all night, okay? But I'm sure Tootsie here wouldn't mind you being her little bed buddy, right, Tootsie? Well, at least tomorrow is Christmas Eve, you know. I mean, what could possibly go wrong then? Mm, just a few Mexican ticks. - Yeah. I'll see you in the morning. If not before then. Oh. Yeah. - Let's go, baby. Come on. - Woo! - Okay, I'm trying, baby. - That's my baby girl. Die, die! - Get her away from the remote. - Oh, yeah. - You're doing great. You learning? - She's doing fine. - What's this nonsense? - Oh! It's actually a prototype from Leif's new game that he built. Ooh! He actually even sold it to a big company. - So, you play games for a living? - I design them. Oh, yes! Score, huerito! Woo-hoo! So, pushing buttons so some space idiotas can kill each other is your idea of a game? - Of course, Dad! - Yes, brother-in-law! Hey, let me tell you something. A game isn't played in someone's living room. - No, no. No. Ay. A real game is played on a field 120 yards long and 80 yards deep, and it's called football. Do you mean soccer? That's what you gringos call it, okay? Football was invented by my Aztec ancestors 700 years ago. And you know what they did to you if you lost? - Uh, sent you to the locker room? - No, man. They sacrificed you to the gods. Ripped open your chest and they pulled out your live, still beating heart. - My God. - On that field, you became a man, an hombre, un patrón. - Oh, like the tequila! - Not like the tequila. Patrón is a boss. Claudia said that you're a captain, man. Are you a captain? Mm, I was the captain of my high school debate team. Oh, debate! Wow, sounds muy macho. All right, captain. It's time for you to play the game of the gods. Ignore him. Meet you on the field in half an hour. - She knows where it is. In... in the park? Ay, no. Ay, ay, ay... Afternoon, huerito. - Hey. Did you get a good night's rest? I hear you're quite the local celebrity. No, man, Claudia's the one who's the rock star. So you and Claudia, you, uh, know each other quite well, huh? Like brother and sister, amigo. You know, she does a really good in and out. You should have her show you sometime. - Excuse me? - Uh, it's a salsa move, where you bring the lady in, and then you lead her right back out. Here, let me show you, Leaf... Hey! Behave! - Come on. - Have a good game, huerito. Twig. - Sorry, babe. - Let's go, y'all. This is a very dangerous game, okay? So you're gonna have to follow my lead. Vámonos. Where'd you go, potty? - ¿Qué? Heads or tails? Tails. I knew you were gonna pick tails. - Ah! Aguas! - I¡Eso! Damnit. Get ready to have a long day there, One Direction. Your starting position is right here. Okay? - Right here? - Yeah. You got it, baby! Come on. - i¡Portero! - What do I do? - Get the left side of the field! Oh, this dude's got nothing, homie. Let's go. Baby, don't use your hands! - Foul! You can't use your hands! - He fouled! Google it! - Baby, you can't use your hands, babe. - Okay! - You used your your fist. - That was illegal. Ha! That wasn't the only thing illegal here. - Hey, give me some Vicks! - No problem. I have my Vicks. - I was protecting myself. - From what? - From the ball. - From the soccer ball? Get him a helmet. Come on, stay alert, stay alert! Let's do this! Watch out, chaparrito, watch out, fool! - Why are you running, fool? - That's right! - Why you move? - Goal! - Keep going! - Get him, Javier! Oh, damn! That's it! What the hell! Long live Mexicans! What are you looking at, ese? You are all dead! To your graves, dumbasses! El Mighty, you're coming to work, ese. I think you killed him, fool! Oh, ouch. Ooh. Ay. Snow in East L.A.? What are these fools doing out there? Why isn't Grandpa here with us? Oh, come sit down, sweetie. Why are you asking that question? Well, grandma said the reason why he isn't here is because he went to the North Pole. Mm-hmm. Actually, son, he went south to Mexico. 'Cause all he ever wanted was a Mexican Christmas. Uh... there's Christmas in Mexico? - Mm-hmm. - Of course, sweetie. Christmas is everywhere. If there's Christmas everywhere, then why isn't he here? And also, why is he in Mexico? Well, because he complained so much about living here that he went back to Mexico. Mm-hmm. And he lived happily ever after. He has a lot of Mexican friends. Is he happy? He loves it. He even has a burro. I'm confused, Mom. Scoot in a little bit, yeah, sweetie? Let's eat. Ho, ho, ho, ho. I'm sorry if I woke you up, Mr. Sanchez. Is that all you're sorry about? Oh... Are you okay? My head hurts, no thanks to you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Leif, what are you doing here? It's because of Claudia. Okay. I know what it's like to be young, and I know what you want from her, so please, don't make me out to be some pendejo, okay? Is that how you felt about your wife when you first met her? Okay, for once, can you just please be clear about what you're trying to say? Mr. Sanchez... I would like to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. Leif... You know, I don't wanna say the cliches, like our love story began in a single glance and, you know, it was at that moment that I knew... that I had encountered my soulmate. But that's exactly what I'm saying. Mr. Sanchez. Are you okay? - There you are. - Hey, hey. I was looking for you. You're gonna miss the piñata. Oh, well, I was, um, talking to your dad. Oh, is... is he okay? Did he wake up? Yeah. Yeah, um, well, sort of. Sort of? He was a little unresponsive. - Unresponsive. What... - No, um... What do you mean by unresponsive? What... I asked your father if I could have his permission... - D-Dad? Dad! Dad! Is this what you mean by unresponsive? Dad! All righty. Let's get this... How are the tamales, Tita? Is that question rhetorical? Of course! I know they are fantastic! Oh. - Give me one, please. Carmen, please bring me some spoons and some forks. - Hey. - ¿Qué? Do you want a "tamale hug"? - What?! - A "tamale hug"? - What is that? - A hug with meat inside! - Ay! - Girls! - Carmen! That old bird, he is up to something. Something. What bird? Over here, m'hijo! You okay? We all gathered here for what we thought was gonna be a traditional Mexican Latino Chicano Christmas. But because of this gringo right here... Aw. I lost my self-respect, my dignity, and I've been humiliated in front of my family. But since it's Christmas, a time to be joyful and merry, I've come out here with a pasted-on smile. It's a season to be happy and joyful, just to tell you, cabrones, Merry Christmas! Feliz Navidad. Not on my tradition. Not on my Christmas! - Your Christmas? What do you mean, your Christmas? Dad, Christmas is supposed to be for everyone, and you have done every possible thing to destroy it. Perdóneme, señor Sanchez. What did you say? You know what I just said. Now, you-you hear it, but you don't listen. - Which is... - Um... exactly why Claudia's more than kind of upset with you, in case you haven't heard. What gives you the right to speak to me like that in my own house? Speak to you in what way? It won't matter which way I speak to you, because you hate this gringo. You know, yet I've done everything to not only be good to your daughter, but to be good to your entire family. You know, and not even because I had to, because I wanted to. You know, I danced the salsa for you guys. - Yeah. - You know? I played soccer. Oh, sorry, I'm saying that wrong. Football. I almost got killed by a chicken, man, and I trimmed your hedges for you. And I showed you respect by asking for Claudia's hand in marriage. - That was out of respect. Yet you show absolutely none to your own daughter, but this isn't or shouldn't even be about me. It should be about her. If you truly loved her, you wouldn't treat her this way. - A ver... Excuse me. A ver, he... um... he asked you for Claudia's hand in marriage and you didn't tell me? You didn't te... I mean, maybe he got a concussion, no? Did he get a concussion from the ball or what? Oh, my love. Is it normal to, uh... to not be able to breathe properly right now? Oh, my God! You look faint. Are you pregnant? Let's see... Okay, okay, this is a season to be merry, - not to get married. - Happy holidays. W... what, hey. Don't leave. Don't leave until we open these goddamn presents. Wow, look at you! Well, that's it. You got the party you wanted, no? Great party! Super fun! I hope you're proud of yourself, eh? You completely messed up this time, Benicio! Completely! Damn, vatos! The-the-the-there goes the n-the-n-n-neighborhood. You're the wrong guy to be saying that, ese. No, really, ese. There goes the neighborhood. Why they look all sad? Because the party wack, fool. We weren't invited. - I would've gone. Shh. - That's right, ese. Wait, wait, where are you going? Guys, don't go. The party... Why are they leaving? I don't know! The party's gonna be great! Where are you going? Babe... your father doesn't like me. Because I'm, you know. - I've ruined Christmas for everyone. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - Babe, my family got the best present this year, and that's you as my husband. When I saw how close you were to your family, I knew I could never propose without your father's permission. Look, my dad, he was just surprised by you, that's all, okay? You know that's not all. I mean, you... you yourself said your father liked surprises. I don't even know what he likes anymore. Well, we know he doesn't like gringos. Babe, my father doesn't care if you're white, or red or green. I'm sure he would mind if I was green. My father finds a reason to not like someone and then he just sticks to it, even if that's not really the reason. Just admit it. This whole thing was a huge mistake. Well, what do you mean? What thing? Like... like us? Your father, he... he had different plans for Christmas. You know, probably had different plans for your life. You know, I know how close you are to your family and that's why I wanted to spend Christmas with them. No, no, Leif. Leif, please, don't go. Leif. Leif. I'm sorry. Hey, perrito, stick around! You guys can make this work! True love prevails, eh? You think I have a chance with her now? Hey, you know what? This for you, homie. Gonna miss you in the hood, huero. Peace out, homie. Man. I actually liked that fool, dog. You know, any dad would love to have a son-in-law like Leif. Even if he was green like an alien. Well, merry freakin' Christmas to us, huh? - Have a good one. - Thank you. Hi, m'hija. Your presents are out there waiting for you. I mean, we could o... we could open them all together, like we used to do when you were a little girl. I'm not a little girl anymore, Dad, whether you wanna accept it or not. Okay. That little girl in those pictures is my daughter. No, no, Dad. I'm your daughter, okay? Aquí mismo, eh? Life-sized. Not everything is about you. You know, why... Why can't it be a boy from the neighborhood like Javier? I mean, he's handsome. He's smart. He's got a good job. He loves his mom, - and goes to church every Sun... - And is gay. He's gay? What do you mean, he's gay? Yeah, Dad, that's the thing. Whether you know it or not, eh? I should've known because he would dance without music, and not... Man, should've seen it. Aparte que even if he wasn't, I wa... that's not who I fell in love with. And you should be able to understand that because I make my own decisions. And now you won't even get the chance to get to know him. You broke his heart and mine. No, don't say that. Don't say that. He had nothing growing up, eh? His parents were poor. He had to wash dishes, mow lawns, park cars. He worked hard for everything that he had, just like you did. - What's that? And you know what? He reminded me a lot of you. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. That kid wasn't that bad after all, wasn't he? On Christmas morning... I wanted a bike like all the other little kids. And when I came down to open my presents... - Mm-hmm. - Bike wasn't there. My dad got me a pair of handlebars and then he told me that one day, you know, he'd get me the rest of the bike that I could put the handlebars on. And he promised me training wheels. And he never got me the training wheels. My poor dad, he worked so hard. Never got anywhere. And one of the last things that he told me was that Christmas was for family. And that's all I wanted to do, was have a nice Christmas like the ones we used to have in Mexico. - Ay. - With the family and... training wheels. How'd he know? How'd he... how did he know? Well, because I... one of these days that you went to work I took them shopping... Santa style. Yeah. But how did he find the exact ones? We went to Olvera Street. Mm-hmm. And you should've seen him, eh? Ooh, that kid? He wouldn't stop until he found them. Yeah. Just because he wanted to make you smile. Baby... You know what you gotta do, amor, right? You got your training wheels. Now go out there and be a father to her. I wanted to tell you that... that I was wrong. In the business that I'm in, you see a lot of beautiful flowers. Like, s-some are very rare and delicate roses, some of them I planted with my hands. And it's my job to protect the roses from the weeds. I thought that it was my job to protect the rose from being hurt. I thought that Leif was another weed that was trying to keep my rose from blooming, but I realize now that my rose has bloomed into this incredible woman and that Leif is now your protector and not me. And that, you know, also papi wants to say is that... uh... that he... he was... I mean, not on purpose. He was the weed. He's been the weed. And that you and Leif are roses. - Yeah, roses. - Yeah. And that we, as a family, because we are a family, that's what we do, we have to protect... somos un garden. And we have to protect the roses. And-and that you know, you make us so, so proud every day, m'hijita. Including Leaf, because he's the coolest and the sweetest boyfriend in all of East... East L.A. Leif, pero mm. Mm-hmm. We got a plane to stop! But, whoa, Clau, you cannot get him back dressed like that. - No, that's true. - Okay. [laughs] Okay. Okay, then let's go! - Let's go! Come on! - Hurry up! Come on, let's go! Drive! Oh, man, what the hell? What? - I don't have the keys! - You had them! - Damn it! - I don't have them! You always... Baby, you always do the same! What about the vatos? Yes, there they are! Oh, my God! - Come on! - I'm coming! - Hey! Cooper! We need a ride! - I got you. - Let's go! - To the airport. Got you, fools, I got you, G. I got you. Let's go, ladies. You guys will fit. Hey, no tips. I'll accept a kiss. Let's go. Come on! - Amárrense! Here we go! - Hit it! Woo! [laughs] I want one of these bedroom. Make 'em bounce. Make 'em bounce higher, homie. Make 'em bounce. This is really cool. Holy crap! I popped my tire, fool. - Ay, what? - My bad. Sorry. - Now what? - Sorry, guys. Sorry, man. - Yo! Y'all need a ride? - Tell Javier yes! Uh, take it back to the bottom of the ocean where it belongs. We'll go steal a car. We'll meet you there, homie. Your little homie learned that in prison. Gate? - Oh, okay. Okay. - Sorry! Okay. Ay, mira, I think it's over there. Come on, let's go! I have to stop my son-in-law from getting... Well, not yet, but getting on the plane. I mean, he's my fiance. I mean, not really. It's not like he proposed to me. I mean, he did propose, - pero mi papá nunca told me. - You have your boarding passes? You can just pat me down so I can go in. I'll tell him all about it. Carmela, no. Wait. - Ma'am, don't touch me. Please, sir. It is very important. My son-in-law, he cannot go on the plane. - Mm-hmm. - So, can you help us with that? The family's future is in danger. - Did she say dangerous? - No, no, no, no. You know, can you guys please step aside? Can you please... Please, guys, step aside, ma'am. Seriously, these gringos are so inflexible. Please, ma'am! Show some respect. I'm just trying to do my job. Oh, no, no, no. I was talking about the other gringos. It's all good. Wow, you are handsome! - Ahí está. No! No! - Wait, wait! Where are you going? Hey, where are you going?! - Brother-in-law! - Oh! Whoa. - Damnit. - Hey, man, I'm just trying to keep my future son-in-law from leaving. Can you please tell your dad to stop doing that? It's the second time. I was center cornerback. East LA had the Fighting Fails. Ow. Does this mean I can have Claudia's hand in marriage? Think I'm getting arrested for nothing? Keep your hands where I can see 'em! - Baby... - Aw. - Will you marry me? Yes... [laughing] yes, a million times, yes. Ay, bueno, I'll put it on myself. It's okay. Oh, fool. I'm sorry. You've got nothin' to be sorry about. No, man, I should've been myself from the beginning. You know, I was such a poser. I was pretending to speak Spanish and I ruined Christmas. Are you kidding me, man? You saved Christmas. My daughter loves you. You made my Christmas the best ever. Welcome to the family! Merry Christmas. Ay, pero where are you taking him? Epa! Where are you taking him?! Hey, you should see what we do for New Years. - Hey, where y'all going? I'ma go this way. They got tamales, so I'm gonna go eat. I'm out. - I'm gonna go with Leaf. - I think his name is Leif. - No, it's Leaf. - No, it's Leif. It doesn't matter, fool. Let's go. Leaf, right? Is it Leaf or Leif? Leaf, he's a swell guy. Yeah, yeah, a lot of people will say Leaf when it's... when it's Leif. This family, it's a taken a lot of, ahem, a lot of correcting. That makes a lot of sense. They're... they're, um, like best friends. - Whoa. Okay. Look at him. Thank you for being such a good, um, friend. I mean, his skin is so perfect and... That makes a lot of sense. Does know Bennie that we're here? I just realized, Bennie's house is pretty nice. Ay... Did I leave the tag on? The only thing that matters in this world for a couple is performance, you know... and that kid looks like he can perform. He's about, what, 5'6 ", 5'7"? I don't really see much there, pero hey, he must be a nice guy, right? Maybe they have their babies. Well... Okay, wait a second. - Maybe later? - Yes, maybe later. Babies... no, espérame. Cut that out. Cut that out. - ¿Y tú? - What? - You wanna marry me? - That's Bennie's mom's, dog. - Put that back. - You're never gonna get married, dog. You know, maybe I should talk to Leif about, like, creating a video game with the vatos, and maybe, you know, we can incorporate the car and then... and maybe they can make some money and finally not be across the street living in their car, right? I was thinking a video game based in East LA would be ama... would sell. And they... where they drive around and maybe steal a car... each other's cars, Put in, like, good music. Tootsie doesn't see color, doesn't see race, doesn't see if they have fur or no fur, pero she is kind of blind. I'ma show up to the wedding, and I'ma... - I'm gonna wedding crash it. - You can't do that, my boy. You can't do that, my boy. It's against the rules, my boy. - Yeah, you gotta respect love. - You gotta respect... - Respeto, homie. - All right, I'll respect. You gotta get her before they get there. Does that make any sense? To, like, the chapel. - Hey, hey, hey, hey... Take a picture! Let's take a picture of... that's for you. Photo, photo, photo. - That's for us. - Photo! Photo! I guess I was wrong. This was not the story about how the gringo stole my dad's Christmas... but how my gringuito saved our Christmas. Feliz Navidad a todos. Merry Christmas, everyone!
