foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Gents! Well, this is weird. No, no, no, no, no. North is supposed to be that way. It's supposed to be months away, years away, decades away. Oh, no, no. Oh shit. No. Pilots flying into the Turks and Caicos have reported sightings of what seems to be an unusually large grouping of waterspouts headed. Northwest to the Eastern seaboard. Whoa, hang on. What did she say? Who? The woman on the TV, the reporter. Oh, right, something about some water tornadoes or something. The size and number of spouts reported seems inaccurate but is being investigated by the Weather. Service. Storms of this nature are unusual this time of year but not uncommon. Come on. See, Amigo. There's nothing to worry about. No, Floyd. Offseason storms are exactly why we should be worried. The sudden appearance of the Northern Lights over the Bermuda Triangle are why we should be worried. Why is no one worried? My bro, you have got to breathe, all right? This triangle fixation was going to be the end of you, my man. Seriously, who thinks this much about triangles all day? That's all you're talking about, these triangles. Floyd, shh. Huh? Whatever is happening is causing quite a stir with sea life. Fishermen from Maryland to Florida are reporting their nets are filling at record rates. Of course, the fish. They're terrified. That's why they're running. We need to go. We all need to go. I'm not going anywhere, all right? I just got my unemployment cheque, my car's in the shop, and I'm not leaving the couch. Floyd, have you not been paying attention? This is what I've been tracking for the last 20 years. I've squandered my entire family fortune on this. Have you zoned out the whole time? Something is coming. Dude, the last guy I rented from. He said aliens were coming. Nothing is coming. Something's coming. And it's bringing all of hell with it. This is a secure line. Code 237585. Give me Travis Love, Department of Homeland Security, and tell him it's an emergency. Are ready? I'll be all right. Are you ready? Here we are ladies. To another night on the grind. To making our daddy's proud. Hmm. Aw. Am I interrupting anything? Just a little snack before we get to work. Oh, Pamela doesn't need a snack. She is the snack. I heard that. A girls' night is going to have to wait. We've had the call. We have got the big fish on the line. This is it. He isn't going to know what hit him. Oh, and we're going to learn from the master. Oh, I'll take that compliment. But you two are already a couple of real man-eaters. And we are hungry. Oh, yeah. So when's it happening? Any minute now. You girls are going to be ready to roll? Sure. I just need to make some adjustments. Oh, yeah, we're primed, primped and packing. I love you two. The feeling is mutual. Very mutual. It looks like somebody wants to get his party started. Girls, go get cozy in the lobby. I'll be right in. Let's make this a night to remember. Hey, sweetie. Yeah, this is Pam. Uh-hum. Why don't you get cozy in the bar? I'll be in soon. I hope you're ready for a night of your life. Ooh! Make me breathe. Hungry again. God damn it, Travis. Why are you wasting our time with this? This is the third time we've had this nutjob in here, each time more ridiculous than the last. Nutjob? Yeah, nutjob. It says here you were kicked out of MIT for plagiarizing research. That's a lie. What does that even matter? Everything I laid out is happening right now. The shifts in the tide, the change of the magnetic pull on the agonic over the Bermuda Triangle. I'm trying to save lives, General. You pompous son of a... Hey, Matt. General, when I joined FEMA as Director, I promised to do things differently. And part of that meant reaching outside of the typical circles of research in order to get a jump on natural disaster. This guy is too outside. Matt, Matt. Look, during my tenure, FEMA's response time has been cut in half, OK? My approval rating is through the roof. So maybe I know what I'm doing. Now, Matt here was the smartest guy that I went to MIT with. So let's just let him finish. Thank you, Travis. But we're wasting time. The anomalies that I've laid out, they're going hyperactive today. The waterspouts out there, they're about to divide and make landfall. Sorry to interject, but we've run operations through the Triangle for years. Waterspouts are not uncommon. The pressure systems out there are perfect for tornadoes. Yes, indeed. But these spouts aren't affected by the weather above. It comes from below, gravitomagnetic surges. Just look at the seismic activity coupled against the magnetic activity. The magnetism doesn't start tornadoes or waterspouts. No, not on Earth, but on Mercury and on the Sun. And I've been tracking the same occurrences over the Bermuda. Triangle. They're whipping up spouts at speeds of 300 miles an hour. That's four times as fast as normal. So we need to evacuate? Yes, immediately. But that's not all. It's about my archeological findings. Just take a look. I swear to god. What's he going to bring up next, huh? Find Atlantis? Did you find Atlantis? No, we have no proof of Atlantis existing. But I found shards of pottery and bits of an obelisk that were brought up. And they talk about weird magnetic occurrences, and the fissures I talked about. But that's not all. They talk about massive creatures, prehistoric beasts, monsters. That area has brought up more prehistoric aquatic fossils than anywhere else on the globe. We pulled up a megalodon jaw on our anchor once. Yeah, I read about that. And that's not all. I had sea turtles, plesiosaurs, dinosaur, orcas. A what? Prehistoric alligator. What else? There were giant squids, and octopuses, octopi, huh? That's not what we have to worry about. It's the carbon dating. It doesn't go back to the Cretaceous period. These findings, there are only 100 or decades of years old. I thought we were getting a briefing on a weather report, Travis, not a goddamn fairy tale. I don't need to stand here and be condescended to by this loser. A loser? I have scientific proof. Get this guy out of here and send out a standard alert telling people to board up their windows or whatever they need to do. Let's all just take a deep breath because last time I checked FEMA was under my jurisdiction. The last time I checked, FEMA's funding was under my jurisdiction. So get this nutjob out of here and put out the goddamn message. You see, General, these spouts are only a fraction of what you need to worry about. You need to worry about what they're bringing up from the deep. Get them out of here. Get these things out of my sight. I don't want to look at them anymore. I'm sorry I shouted at you. It's OK, dad. Well, that could have gone better. Well, I'm sorry, man. But I'm not here to win friends or make approval points. I don't think there's any danger in that. You could have held off using the word beasts or fucking monsters. No, I couldn't because I've been shunned my entire career, and I finally have something legitimate to tell them, and they won't even listen. I'm listening, OK? I'm on your side, bud. I get it, OK? You've had a rough ride these past 20 years, but let's see this thing through. OK. OK, now how much time do we have? I don't know. Half hour, an hour? Every minute up... There as a minute I wasted tracking the storm. And these spouts, do you think they're going to have these things inside? I don't know. It's a hypothesis. It's yes. And it's going to be bad, real bad. OK, I'm going to need a minute. Find us a car. Find a car? Travis? Fuck. Hey, sweetie. You must be Clive. Clive, daring, in the flesh. Well, well, well, you look even better than the photo the agency sent. That's rare. Well, I am glad you like what you see. Bloody like it, sweetheart. I know you'll make me have a lot of fun tonight, a lot of fun. Bartender, give my girl here a drink. What are you drinking, babe? Oh, not for me. Thanks. Why don't we go upstairs and get this party started the real way? Now you're talking daddy's language. Keep the change, mate. Maybe don't send time. Oh, you always in long as hell. As you can see behind me, we have multiple waterspouts incoming. And this is the largest grouping ever reported. We have gotten word from FEMA that a severe storm warning is in effect, and so please stay indoors and away from windows. Back to you in the studio. And we are out. Do you know what? I think we should get ourselves to safety pronto. Not a chance in hell, Kiff. The last time you did this, you made me miss the cops shooting that looters dick off. We have the chance of a lifetime to cover this. We need to get closer. Go, go, punch it. The further away... if we can get from the coast, the better. Yeah, you're going to hate me, Matt, but I'm going to have to go back to the coastal airstrip. Why? That's right towards the storm. And we wasted an hour talking to those government assholes. Yeah, well, I didn't realize it was this bad, OK? Look, I've just had word my assistant is going to be waiting with a plane. I can go fly straight to the Pentagon get around all of Wilson's red tape. You? What about me? Come on. I've been naughty. You need to, sweetheart. You teach me innocent. As you can be as rough as you like. You love that? Yeah. Let's get to know you. Again. Again. Ha-ha-ha. You dirty girl. There's plenty more where that came from. Who is at the door? You've been a very, very bad man, Clive, very, very bad. Yeah. So I have to order in some extra hands. Wow. Oh, I love where this is going. Oh, thank you, Pamela. I think we are going to like it a lot more. Yeah, we really, really, really like talking down that boy. What the fuck? Agent Pamela Rasey from the FBI. This is Pepper and Tina from Interpol. We have been tracking you for the last six months. We have got you on drug smuggling, we have got you on rape, and we have got you on murder, and the thing that we fucking hate the most, human trafficking. Fuck you. You're an asshole. Pam, let's speed this up. The storm is getting angry. Yeah, copy that. I'll let the team know that we have target acquired and ready for extraction. Bitch, she's got nothing. And if think that you know, I'd never seen a fucking jail time because my network extends all over the world. I said shut it, Clive, or I'll shut it for you. Hello, Donovan. Over. Donovan, thank god. What? You cannot be serious. Well, what the hell are we supposed to do until then? We need backup now. Pam, we got to move. Damn it. What's happening? The roads are flooded, the trucks are stuck, and the chopper can't land on the roof is too goddamn dangerous. We're on our own. That's going to be a problem. And a fucking timing. We can't just leave him. Can't we? No, on me. This is a fucking beaut. We're the only ones down here, Kiff. Our Channel 7 is going to shit themselves. Are we rolling? Listen, Karen, I got a bad feeling. Start rolling. All right, I am rolling. We are in the shadow of these quickly approaching waterspouts. They are massive, and they seem... Zoom in, Kiff. Zoom in. They seem to be full of creatures. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Karen, stuff is coming out of these twisters. We got to go. Keep rolling. Damn it. Karen, you can stay if you want, but I'm getting help out of here. Get back here. Why are you stopping? You can't do that. Actually, I can because it's an election year, Matt. And I give a shit about approval points. I figured I'd kill myself a couple of monsters, maybe boost my approval rating. Every crisis needs a hero, buddy. Now get out the fucking car. What? Out! Out! Get out of the fucking car. Out! Get out of the fucking car. All right. But I've got the calculations. I know how to stop the thing. I can disrupt the agonic line. And why do you think I want to do that, huh? FEMA is in the disaster business, OK? The more monsters to kill, the more approval points. Do you understand? You son of a bitch. Thousands of people will die. Oh, I'm so sorry, Matt. You should have learned your lesson at MIT. Don't leave your research where people can get their hands on it. It was you? You fucked me. I share everything with you. I showed you all my research. And you were the one who did this. You're fucking lied to me. Don't be so surprised. You made it too easy, Matt. Honestly, it was like shooting fish in a barrel. It was embarrassing. Now this is the point where I say good luck, buddy, friend. But we both know we're not friends, right? Now get out the fucking way. Wait. You don't leave me here with nothing? No, not nothing, Matt. You've still got Floyd. Fuck you. Fuck you, Travis. Fuck! Fuck! Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry, folks. But I'm locking you in. It's far too dangerous out there. My cousin called me and told me that there's sharks and gators and all kinds of crab killing people on the streets. What a load of bullshit. You're telling me there's sharks on land? My cousin ain't no liar. He drinks like a fish, but he's as honest as they come. You can't do that. You can just lock us in. It's illegal. You're right. But so is Grady. Look at the TV. Well, I am not staying here. I'll find somewhere safer. Come on. Ugh, I don't think so. Grady, go ahead and let them go. OK, but it's the last time I'm unlocking the store. Good luck to you. If you all want to leave leave now. We should... not to leave. No. No, no, don't leave. No. Now what do we do? I don't know. Whoa! What the fuck? Whoa! You can do whatever you want in your rooms. I just don't need you to... The FBI, honey. We're just leaving. The door's locked. Why? It ain't safe. I'm sorry. It's too dangerous. The storm has intensified. And it may be hard to believe, but there are prehistoric sea creatures and... Come again? What the hell are you talking about? The news. Whoa! OK, that is pretty bad. Well, that's an understatement. OK, well, we need to change directives. And let me contact Donovan. Keep the loverboy here covered. On it. Laura? Hey, are you all right? What's going on? It's OK. Can he breathe? No, I can't. I think the question you want to ask is, does he deserve to breath? No. What? Laura, can you breath? Look, do you have a room or maybe a cage somewhere for unruly guest? Like, I said, you can do whatever you want to in your room. Well, our room doesn't exist. And she asked you a fucking question. Put that away, will you? What? Are you crazy? Laura? Laura? What are you doing? Laura. I think she's having cardiac arrest. She's having a heart attack. No. I am sorry. What the hell happened? Oh, my god. She's dead. No. I wouldn't go that way. Fucking Travis. I missed that flight. What the hell is going on? I tried calling multiple times. There's a storm, and there's sharks and alligators. Why are there women with guns in my lobby? Where's Laura? She's dead, Don. There was a mishap with a gun, and she went into some kind of shock. And I think she had a heart attack. Jesus! Did you call an ambulance? The lines are dead, internet, everything. The alarm's going off all afternoon. Fuck! I go to sleep for a couple of hours, and this whole place goes to shit. What's the plan? Plan? There's no fucking plan, Don. Oh, I sealed the doors. Why did you do that? I told you, the giant creatures. Kelly, there's no such thing as giant creatures, OK? There's no such thing. You keep telling yourself that. Fuck! No, no, no, you don't want to go this way. Stop! Stop! Shit. Open the door. Open the fucking door! No way, man. No. Open the door, Grady. No, I already said I'm not opening this door again. I'm not letting in a bunch of crabs and octopus and all sorts of fucking sea creatures in here. There is no way there are sea creatures. Guys, let him in. Please. Fucking shut it. Shut it. What are you gonna do with that? I'm going to shoot everything that comes through that door. Nothing's getting through that glass. That's the same stuff they have at SeaWorld. We put that up after Katrina. It can hold up to eight feet of water. Bullet proof too, even thwarted a drive-by. Nothing's getting through there. See? Let's fallback. Oh. So you're with FEMA? Yeah. No, I'm a contractor. I'm a scientist. My name's Matt. Are you the manager? Yeah, I'm Don. And this is our maintenance guy, Grady. And Kelly here is my assistant. I'm the head concierge. What exactly are you scientist of? This is going to sound weird, but my specialty is what's going on right now. Well, then I guess we're lucky to have you. Thanks for letting me in. What's their deal? I don't know about the ladies, but the guy stayed here before. He has a lot of escorts, too. We don't usually disclose information about our guests. Isn't that right, Kelly? Right. Listen, do if word got out about the storms or the creatures at all? I don't know about nationally, but the local news is reporting it. What did they say? I can show you. The front desk DVR, I saved the last couple of hours from the weather feed. Do you want to see? Yeah, that'd be great. Show me, please, yeah. No offense, Matt, but how did a scientist and a here? And if you knew about all this, why don't you tell anyone? I was on the way to the Pentagon. I had a double-cross on the way to the airstrip. Well, that sounds like a trip to Washington, all right? Why were you going to Washington? I was hoping to brief the president about the storm and the creatures. Do you the president? No, not me, my friend, ex-friend, the one who double-crossed me. Thanks for recording this. Appreciate it. Well, I'm a bit of a weather nerd. Pause it right there. Yeah. Can you zoom in on the back? Sure. Yeah, you see how it's moving along the agonic line, right? It's going to hit the geomagnetic fields, and then it's going to split and multiply and then head north. Waterspouts don't last long on land, not even once that strong. And spouts don't move along magnetic lines. No, these aren't like normal spouts. They aren't affected by weather patterns. These are magnetic, and they're going to continue north and continue to build energy until they potentially hit the North Pole unless we stop them. Let them finish that little meeting, and then we're going to get Clive locked up somewhere safe. Hmm. Safe? He should be out there with those things. Easy. Don't hurt him. We need him in one piece for the trial. I'm sorry, but this whole situation is freaking me out. We all saw that giant fucking crab, right? Yeah. Can we stand up and take control of the hotel, please, or something? Right now our mission is this piece of shit. We're just got to let them take care of their own protocols, and if anything gets in the way of our operation, then we'll reassess. What the hell is it now? Speak. Shit! What was that? No. Oh. No, honey, it's not going to work. Oh my god. Holy shit. What the hell are you doing? Look, Tina panicked. If the two-ton octopus is trying to suck the living shit out of you. We'll do that. Look, it's under control. I said the glass is strong, but it's best we don't try and test it. Instinct. Sorry. Like I said, it's under control. Look. Maybe it's best we don't leave our only protection in the hands of the angry prostitutes. Excuse me? What about this guy? He's all tied up. He looks strong. He'd probably help us when the time comes. You don't fucking touch him. And we're not prostitutes. Sorry. Escorts, call girls, call people, I just think it's a liability that you're packing. Don't judge a book by its cover, asshole. And you are? My name's Matt. Matt, well, you sure have a way with women, man. But I am Pamela Rasey from the FBI. This here is Pepper, and this is Tina from Interpol. Sorry, I... This is Clive Delaney. And you are right, Don. He is strong. He is really strong. He's killed three people with his bare hands, and that is just in the time that I've been trailing him. So yeah, he probably won't be much help to you unless, I don't know, you want to buy some children? Yeah, he's a real piece of shit. Then why'd did you bring him into my hotel? Because guys like him don't like to be arrested by undercover prostitutes in front of their families, do they? Well, I'm glad we have Charlie's Angels here, but Matt is a scientist. Well, that's one book I could definitely judge by the cover. And he knows all about the weird storms. Mhm. That's great. But what about the T rex-sized octopuses? Yeah, I know about those too. Please enlighten us. The storms aren't like normal storms. They're like flare-ups you see on the sun. And these ones originated in the Bermuda Triangle, a place we know very little about. I know it's bad news. Indeed. And in my 20 years of geological study that led me to archaeological study because all the stuff that was coming out of there, proof of prehistoric life, but nobody believed me because it didn't fit into museums narrative of historical order. So there's politics in the science world too? There's politics in all of it. I've been forced out of libraries, everything. They laugh me out of my own symposiums. I bet. Oh, I guess you're having the last laugh now. I'd be laughing a whole lot more if I wasn't so scared. Well, what can I do here? Shut up. Listen, there are dozens of those things out there. God only knows what's going on in the rest of the city. Sir, the last transport is ready to roll. Go ahead and get on it, Meghan. I'm not going anywhere. The majority of spouts have passed us by. But, sir, it's hell on Earth down there. Hell on Earth is in Iraqi POW camp. Do you think I spent two years getting my toenails pulled off to get taken out by a storm? You don't know Abernathy Wilson. Sir, the monsters Matt warned us about. I have it covered. But sir... I said I have it covered. The military has to know. Is that who you were checking in with earlier? Yes. Well, of course, the storm has ruined any chance of them getting to us. And well, the comms have gone out with the storm. Yeah, of course, they have because it's a magnetic storm, and it's going to render anything digital completely useless. Our only chance is maybe using a shortwave radio. Matt, I keep a shortwave radio with my tools. I left it over these tower. Yeah, that'd be a big help. We can you get a message out, but without the government shortwave passcodes, they're not to listen to us. Right, ma'am? Well, I learned Morse code in basic. But shortwave codes and they're from inside. Tina, Pepper? Don't look at us either. Interpol phased out shortwave years ago. Well, there has to be a way, right? Matt, what about your government friend? Oh, he's dead. But he did leave me some codes. I have him in my go-bag. Of course, I still have Floyd. Who the hell is Floyd? Then we'll go to the tower and wait. Woo! Ha-ha. Oh baby. Oh baby. It was a good job. You look, like you want to fucking mouth. Open it. You're off it now. I ain't going to fucking happen. I My fucking ticket out of here. And you lady, you should know you're coming with me as well. Now. Fuck. Bad move, Clive. Yeah, you don't have the codes. I'll go and get your A list, please, science boy. I've got all over the case. for the military's got their dicks out there. Now you hurry up, you hurry up, you put your hands up, you put your hands up, and you get on the floor. You fucking little slag. Don, it's locked. We're dead. The elevators? There are up, but they shut down an emergencies. Of course. They told me that you've got the key. I don't. I can get them. There's a spare set behind the front desk. West Tower, there's a stairwell. We have to go up to the fifth floor, and there's a hallway that connects over. To the stairwell. Move. Yeah, let's go. Come on. You get everyone to the stairs. I'll hold off the crabs. You can't shoot through the shells. It won't work. But you can't hurt them. Aim for the eyes. They'll pop like water balloons. OK, I got it. Now, move. Go. I got this. I got this. Go. Go. Go. We're here, you bastards. Shit. Tina. Keep moving. I'll be right back. No, Pepper. No. No, where are you going? Kelly, don't. Let him go. These people are crazy. Don, Matt knows how to stop this. Bullshit. He's a nutjob. You heard him. As if his roommate has government codes. Let's just find Grady and get out of here. Pepper, stop. If the crabs got Tina, she's gone. They can crash 10 times her body weight with their claws. I don't need a fucking science lesson. I'm sorry. It's just the odds of hers... This is my first time You talk to me about the fucking odds. I'm sorry. I don't... I'm not good with people. I don't know how to... Oh, you're terrible with people. You lab coat guys, you're all the same. When the shit hits the fan you're fucking useless. You think me? Yeah. Well, I know about women in the Bureau, too. I know you all have FBI daddies and you're used to strong, decisive men. Which you are not. No, I'm not. And you're mad. And you're allowed to be mad. And you can be mad at me, but that's fine. But right now, what we have to process, no one in the history of the world has had to process before. And you'll process later. Good. Now we move. God. Can I ask one question. Why do you help government and people that hate you? Because I took an oath. I wouldn't end up to be another loser in a basement yelling at the internet. Fair play. Wait. Why do you put yourself in the path of dangerous men? I took an oath too. All right. Follow me. Yeah. Oh, come on, 6939 megahertz. You tune it in. Tune it in. Aye, aye, Captain. You can let her go. I can run the radio just fine on my own. Better for the Morse code. I thought you said we weren't contacting the military. My best blokes are plucked from the military. They make the best smugglers, and they monitor that channel for me 24/7. Now you get on that machine, darling. You tell my blokes that I'm alive and where we are. You do a good job, I'll get you out of here. I might even let you be my girlfriend for a while. You do what you have to. You'll be fine. Have you done it yet? Yes. someway. In the meantime, I bet you'd give me a little kiss. When my mates respond, tell me how long it's going to be before they get here. Right, right. In the meantime, how about you give me a little kiss? Yeah, come on. Damn, girl. Look, go open the door for the others. I'll tie him up and keep an eye on him. Thanks, Grady. If he moves, I give you permission to pop him. Go take the radio to Matt. The faster he gets the word out, the faster we have a chance of being saved. Thanks, Grady. I like your message, by the way. Oh, you understand that? Telling his friends at the feds were on to him to turn themselves in and release the girls. Nice touch. Are you ex-military? Indeed I am. I thought so. Come on, guys. It's this way to the other stairwell. Is Tina... She didn't make it. I'm sorry. Thanks. She was one of the good ones. Fucked up. This shouldn't happen. Well, it's happening. So we need to stay vigilant, guys. Scientists like Matt should have a forum. There's a podcast, and it's all about... Enough about the podcast. We get it. We need to keep moving. I keep hearing noises in those vents. It could be the octopus. They might be following us. In the vents? That thing was as big as a trunk. Yeah, well cephalopods can constrict their bodies. Into a space, just an inch to cross. Yeah, and one that size, a vent would be feasible. And then we move. Where to? This way. We need to get to the other stairwell. That way, we can hook up to where Grady left his card. That sounds like a plan. Then we can get the jumping inside and get the radio. He still got the gun. But I'm going to lead. I am not losing anyone else on my watch. She is such a bad ass. Yeah, she really is. OK, from now on, be careful. You're too important to lose in all of this. Thanks. Pam, Tina, here, I have the radio. Oh, did that sting? So that girl whooped your ass, good boy. Fuck you, geezer. No, fuck you. And I've seen you in here before acting like you run the world. What the fuck, man? That hurt? Because it felt good to me. You like being in control. Well, I'm in control now, motherfucker. Ugh. I'm the guy who cleaned up your messes, and tonight you're the mess. You're going to kill me? But you better me cause if you don't I will fucking kill you. Yeah, you know they tried to kill me, Granada, Iraq? Now I do the killing. Well, come on, dude. Bring it on, big boy. Come on. I don't think you realize just how much I'm going to enjoy doing this. And I'm doing this nice and slow, just like I did in Guantanamo. Gitmo? I wrote the handbook for Gitmo. And tonight, I'm using all my greatest hits on you. Crazy, mate. There is out. I ain't fallen for that shit, Clive. No, I'm not kidding. There is something bad. Now shut your mouth. Turn the fuck around. Oh, did you hear that? What? We have to keep moving. Wait. I heard it too. Hello? Pam. It's Pepper. Pepper? It's Pepper. She broke free. Pepper? Pepper? Pepper? Pepper? I have the radio. Pam, do you know? No, we know. Now get your ass down here. Quick. OK, I'm coming. Hurry up. I know. Yeah, I have Tina's gun. Where is Grady? Oh, he's with Clive. He's safe. I overpower him, and I have the radios. How did you pass the crabs? Oh there was... They got scared by this fucking crocodile. What croc? No! No! Run. Fuck you. No, no, no. Come on. Go. Go. Oh, thank God you are alive. Oh, shit, shit, shit. Come on. Hey. Don't. I don't need to be comforted. I just need to get my shit together and leave out of here. You're allowed. Don't talk to me. So fucking pissed. My friend just got mutilated. Well, I am. She died getting you radio. You're going to step up and make it count. It's not your fault so we're just gonna focus. Pamela, that's... we just need to breathe. And we just stop for a minute. One minute. Get your breath backed on, then we move. Move where? The whole place is infested. The tunnels. What tunnels? When they were excavating, they found these old Civil War tunnels, the historic landmarks. So the contractors had to integrate them into the buildings foundation. Then let's lock it out. And they hook up with the army base that's on a cliff about half a mile out. The trouble is they built it like a maze on purpose. Here. Making a map, smart move. Let's do it. But Pamela, it goes deeper underground. I'm worried the only place that Matt's going to get a signal is up here. He's not going to get anything down there. Well, look, I'll help you make a map. Matt, you try and get some word out. Kelly, you stay here. And if you see or hear anything, you scream. OK. Good luck. I got it. You two go. Never met anyone like you. Thanks. At college, none of my professors went anywhere near fringe science or conspiracy theories. And now the government is releasing videos of UFOs. And look, for once it's a real one. Very real. Floyd. Floyd, this is Matt. Can you hear me? Floyd. Oh, shit. I can't even believe you had a plan to end all of this. I don't know if I had a plan. I had some contingencies. The spouts themselves can easily be disrupted. And I'm guessing you can knock them off their axis with the EMP. Exactly, yeah. And what about the contingencies for the cephalopods and the dino suckers. Dino. You know your stuff. Weather geek, science geek. Yeah, well, that one wasn't too scientific, I'm afraid. Then what was it? Military. I figured if we have enough weapons to blow up the world a few times over a few prehistoric sea creatures should be a piece of cake. Sometimes. The easiest answer. Exactly. Floyd, it's Matt. Floyd, can you hear me? Matt? Matt, oh-oh-oh. Oh, Matt, this is Floyd, man. Holy shit. Floyd, it's Matt. Floyd, can you hear me? It's Matt. Listen mate, you were right, all right? There are monsters and they are stores. They're going to get me. I need your help. The shark's everywhere. Man, I believe you. I believe everything you've ever said. You were right about all of it. Floyd, by the front door, there was a go bag, did you happen to have grabbed it? Of course, I got your go bag. A walrus crushed my PlayStation, Matt. Come on. Excellent. Very good, man. Excellent. Take a look in the bag. There should be a folder marked Travis Love. Do you see it? There is going to be some codes in there. You need to read those codes to the government. Yeah, I found it. OK, good. All right, there's a government code in there. And there's a frequency code. I need you to turn the radio to that frequency and then put in the government code. That should open a clear line of communications. Can you handle that? Yeah, OK. Yeah, I can do that. Yes, excellent. Great. Then there there'll be a folder there. It's full of contingencies, EMPs, creature suppression. You need to read all of that to the government. You got it? OK, dude. Thank God, Floyd. Listen, man, the fate of the world is in your hands. I can do this. I got this. I know you could, man. Thank you. And call me back on this frequency to make sure it all went through, OK? 10-4. Good, buddy. He really is going to get through. Yeah. Yeah. Pamela. Matt, my arm. Pam. Shoot it. I don't want to shoot it. Fucking shoot it. Yeah, I am shooting. Pam. Shoot it. I can't penetrate the skin, Don. It's too thick. You can do it. Just do it. I have got this, Don. I have got this. Do it. Whoa. Ha-ha. Holy shit. Thank you, dear Lord. For a second there, I thought I was... No! Don! No. Don. Don? Pamela? I'm completely turned around. Yeah, me too. What's in here? Oh, god. This is all water. This is coming up from the ocean. And that would probably be a bad thing. Real bad. Come on. Hey! Oh, shit. Why have you left you're spot? We had. Where is Don? It was a giant snake. I took it out. And then there was just tons of giant spiders and creatures. I didn't think anything could get in down here. That's obviously not the case. And now you guys have gone the wrong way. We're going to have to double back on ourselves. What is that? Oh, no. Are you saying... It's that Don's? This is our map. Yeah, OK. Well, I didn't have a choice. This is our only way. Look, guys, we've got to get out of here. Well, Guys, run. Get out there. Run. Guys run. Go, go go. Run. If can here me, I'll meet you at the tower. Run. Shit. That was close. I've never seen a shark that big before. No one in 3 and 1/2 billion years has. It's the second one I've seen today. Floyd, saw something though, right? About Floyd, he barely even pays his rent on time. It's not like he's a reliable friend or anything. Is there such a thing? We have to go back for Pamela. She said let's head to the towers then she would find us. I know, but she'll never get past that meg on her own. She can go the tunnels the other way. Come on, Matt. Make a decision. To the tower. Come on. Two bullets, of course. Here. Fuck. It's locked. Come on, good buddy. This is Floyd. Come in. Floyd? It's Floyd. Floyd, we were underground. What happened? The military, man, they believed everything I said. I read all your reports. And what did they say? They said that they got it under control, I just hang tight, and help is on the way. Oh my god, Floyd. You did it. You fucking did it. Yeah, I did. Well, and Matt get this, they thanked me for my service. That's incredible, man. That's incredible. Yeah, I asked if they could wipe my records, and they said no problem. What? Not in those words exactly, but they were pretty cool, man. Floyd, you fucking rock star. Yeah, can you let my family know? Sure. But you can tell them. No, Matt. No, I can't. I don't think I can. What's happening? What's going on? The sharks, man. They're there... yeah, the sharks are all over me. Floyd, get out of there. Go, go. Dude, I can't. They've got me. All right, this is it. I think this is the end. I bet I'll fuck us, shit, shit. Floyd? Fuck. Come on. I am sorry. I'm so sorry. Now I really have nothing. That's not true. Before tonight, I used to hate people. I really hate them, talking to them being around them. But now that all my predictions are coming true... They're all you need. Yeah. Uh, Matt, you're squeezing a bit too tight. It's not me. Stay rigid. Don't go limp. Don't go limp. Yes, Matt, yeah. Dig your fingers into the suction cups. Yeah, fight it. Keep fighting it. Keep fighting it. Fight it. Give me your hand. No, no, no, no, no, no, don't let go. Don't let go. No, don't let's go. No, no, no. Matt. Matt, Where's Kelly? They got her. They followed us. They knew. How? They're smartest animals in the ocean. They have an intelligence. Fuck! What? I am going to be so fucking clever all the time. Said stuff like it's the devil's triangle, and it's going to be hell on Earth. This is worse. This is so much fucking worse. It seems so much easier on paper, huh? I just met Kelly tonight. I get it. She made me feel important. Matt. Important. Do you have somebody to go back to? Sort of. Mitch. But I hadn't even thought about him until you asked me something earlier. What? Why do I put myself in the mouth of dangerous men? When you asked me that I didn't even think about him. I didn't think about Clive. I thought about Mitch. After seeing people die tonight, there is no way I'm going back to him. Well, maybe there is a bright side. Matt. Matt? Wow! Pamela, you were meant to be mine tonight, weren't you, you slippery bitch? And I hate it when I don't get what I paid for. And we're splashed out in the whole package with you. And I'm going to get every single penny's worth, sweetheart. Fuck you. Get outside. Move. Lead. Get us out of here. Move. Go on. Go on. Go on now, get in there. Asshole. You killed the man that was going to save us. You never stood a chance, love. Do you know what? I couldn't wait to kill you when I thought you as a protege. Now I know you're a fed. I'm going to enjoy it even more. Fucking do it then. Yeah, after I get your kit off. Fuck you. Move on. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Oh yeah. Oh, I said it. Go on. Go get them out. Enough. Matt? You stupid fucking twat. What were you thinking? What? She was going to be a hero. You are not a hero, pal. Get up, you asshole. Feds can't get in now, Pamela. You know that. No. They'll kick you out. You know this. And all of this would have been for nothing. Now are you willing to risk that? I don't think so. You're gonna have to see this through. I'm sorry. Are you going to tie me up again? I'm not going to throw you off but that thing will. Oh, bollocks. Matt run. Keep moving. Look, are you OK? I don't know. I've never been in a fight before. My ears blown off. I can't hear anything over here. You're a fucking hero, Matt. You're my hero. I've seen what he does to women. It's over now. This is far from over, Matt. I know. I know. But if I can get to the top of the tower, maybe we get a signal. Floyd got through. If I could tell them where we are... Floyd got through. Well, let's get to the top of the tower. Come on. Let's try it. OK, come on. Matt run. Go. Get in here. My heart's beating out of my fucking chest. Just breathe. Breathe. Look, give me the radio. Let's tune into my channel It's our contingency plan. It'll be fine. Hello, this is Agent Pamela Rasey. I'm with Matt. Do you copy? Hello, is anybody there? Can you hear me? Over. Shit! The radio's gone dead. It has gone dead. They got the message. Floyd, you son of a bitch. He did it. It's incredible. But the spouts are only part of the problem. Matt, right. Oh my god. You really thought of everything, Matt. Yeah, I did it. But the others... I know. Matt? Matt, do you read me? We have your location, and we're sending help to rescue you now. Yeah, we're at Amber Marley Point. We're in the tower, at the top of the tower. Copy that. Envoy inbound. The President sends his thanks. Stay safe. Over. Good. The President even knows who I am. You really kept true to your oath, Matt. And then some. You're a fucking hero. Are you OK? Yeah.
