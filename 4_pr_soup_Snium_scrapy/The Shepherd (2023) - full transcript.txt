Hello, there! - Hello. - That yours? Sergeant Joe Marks, jump in. I'll run you back to the mess. - Thank you. It's good to be in the warm. - I expect it is. Flying Officer, Freddie Hook. - That was close. - You were lucky in this fog. Yeah. My radio and electrics failed out of the North Sea. I was guided in by another aircraft. - Surprised you managed to find the place. - What do you mean? We're not an operational station, haven't been for years. We're just a storage depot now. - So this isn't RAF Miriam St. George? - That's another ten miles away, sir. - This is RAF Minton. - Minton? I've never heard of it. I saw your runway lights... and... Well, looks like I've plonked my Vampire down onto the wrong airfield. - Sorry. - Don't mention it, sir. You got the short straw, having to spend your Christmas on duty here? Yes. Let's get you settled. - This will warm you up, sir. - Thank you. Come on, Lizzie. Come on, Lizzie. Pick up. - Did you get through? - Strange. Well, it is Christmas. You've been here long, Joe? Since the beginning of the war when the station opened. - It's different then. - Hmm. Back then, it was full of young pilots flying mission after mission, even after their nerves were in shreds. - Did you have family in the Force, sir? - Yeah. Yeah, my father. - I'm sorry. - Missing in action over Germany. - So you followed him into the Force? - Yeah, yeah, I did. Not right away, though. National Service. Well, thank God there's no war on. Let's hope we don't have to go through anything like that again. - May I, sir? - Thank you. Who's the pilot, Joe? Oh, that's Mr. John Kavanagh. - He was here during the war, sir. - Kavanagh? Yes. Often used to sit at that table where you were sitting. A Canadian pilot. - What squadron was that, Joe? - Pathfinders. Mosquitoes they flew. I believe Mr. Kavanagh was the best of them all. But then, I'm biased. I was his batman. - Johnny Kavanagh. - When the squadron returned after dropping marker flares over targets in Germany, he'd have his Mosquito refueled. Take off again. Alone. - He used to guide them back here. - Yes. He used to go out over the North Sea... looking for a crippled plane, sometimes in fog so dense you couldn't see your hand. Just like tonight. Well, he brought me home tonight. Oh, I don't think so, sir. Mr. Johnny went out on his last patrol Christmas Eve, 1943. Just 14 years ago tonight. He never came back. He went down with his plane... somewhere out there over the North Sea. Well, good night, sir. Oh, and uh... Happy Christmas. We saw you on the radar looked like you were heading for Miriam. - Then you just vanished. - We lost you around about here. - Why did you... - I was led down. Old guy here turned on the runway lights and saved my life. This place shut down years ago at the end of the war. Uh, it's been abandoned ever since. Come on. Let's get you back to civilization, sir. Home for Christmas. Crocodile Lima, Monkey Delta. Can you read me? Do you require assistance? Monkey, Delta, Crocodile Lima, Skipper here. Flank damage and hit from pursuing enemy fighter.
