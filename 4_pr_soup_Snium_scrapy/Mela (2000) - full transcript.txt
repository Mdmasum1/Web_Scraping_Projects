She's young and tender? Really? - I swear it on your paunch! You have sworn on my paunch. I'll give you another opportunity.

You'll certainly make it someday! Let's go, smart-ass! Load the stuff and hit the roads! Looks like destiny is going to smile on me at last! Stop! What have you stopped here for? - For a bath. I'll have a bath, freshen up and go after the girl! Bathe here now? But you bathed last week, didn't you? Smart-ass! You wouldn't know about the girls! A guy's got to look good to woo the girl! Look! My red trousers and the yellow shirt to meet Champakali! Shankar! Take a dip! The water's just great! You're alive, Rupa... But what for? "You have nothing left... you are finished!" Your brother has been killed "You have nothing to live for, Rupa. No one at all" "You're all alone, Rupa... you're on your own" "No, Rupa! This is no time to despair" "This new lease of life is a boon to destroy the enemy" "He has ruined you... he has snatched your brother from you" "You must avenge your humiliation, Rupa" How will you accomplish it? Who will help you?" There is someone! Your fianc?e. The man your brother chose for you "He will accept you... he will protect you" "And he will make sure that you are given justice" Hey frog! Are you coming out or must I leave? Here I come... He won't even let me bathe in peace! "These clothes I choose for you, Champakali..." "A few short ones; a few fat ones..." Kishankali! Don't you look gorgeous! Blame the waters! It turns a man into a woman! Where are my clothes, smart-ass? - I don't know. I was asleep. And my clothes vanished, eh? - An animal could've taken them. Why would an animal steal my clothes? They go around in the nude. And this is... Wait a minute! This is a ghagra-choli! It was no animal! It was a girl! The bloody thief has made away with my new trousers and shirt! She left these tatters for me... What the hell were you up to? Shut up! My wallet was lying in my trousers! She stole that too! Hey thief! You have a lot of money, lady... what will you eat? Pancakes? Beans? What will you have? Get me anything. - In a jiffy. Excuse me... - Anything else? How do I get to Belapur? - It's an 18-hour journey. There's a bus for Khanpur. From there you take another bus to Belapur. But today's bus has left. You will get a bus tomorrow. Look there, boss! What stuff! - She's delicious! Like liver-fry! - She's a whore. A whore? - Of course. Look at her counting the money. How'd she get so much of money? That girl stole my clothes and you didn't even notice! You notice girls. I don't. Just shut up now and let's eat. C'mon. Can you think of anything but food? - Can you think of anything but girls? C'mon! How can you compare food with girls! That's a sin! Girls are... Damn her! Shankar! Look there! A girl again? - Look at her clothes! She's the one who stole my clothes and she's wearing them, too! The same red trousers and yellow shirt. I'll go and get her. - Relax. Why score with every girl you see? - Damn it! You suspect me?! There! She has my wallet too! I can't take this anymore... I'll push the whore into business. The bloody thief! I'll get her right now! Gotcha! You sit here counting my money! What did you think? That I wouldn't catch up with you? Shankar! The wallet! You don't know who I am! Kishan Bindas, the school drop-out! Step out of those clothes... Go on! Strip! What the hell are you doing? Get lost! This yellow and red is mine! - Where have You sprung from? The red and yellow is mine! - I saw her first! So does it belong to you? I bought it in Bhopal! I've paid 300 bucks for it! I'll pay 600. No... it's not up for sale. Shut up, jerk! C'mon... Don't you touch her! You'll spoil the crease! The crease? - Sure. It costs money! And it looks great. - What crease, punk? Narinder! Isn't he crazy? - Forget him. Go for the babe. The babe, eh? You have torn my yellow shirt! Godamn you! One, two... six of them! That's one too many! It's time for my lunch! What are you talking about? I'll get killed! You hit me when I'm talking to someone...! I'm getting a beating and you're enjoying a yogurt-drink! You messed with them. So you handle them. You aren't a friend! You're an enemy! Rather than... - Okay. Let me eat. Don't watch! Kill him! You've joined me, Shankar! Man in the beard! Wait! Why bash me up? The girl's vanished! She has vanished! To hell with you, you thief! She has fled with my trousers and my shirt! But we've saved the wallet. Give it to me. Who's going to pay for the losses you've caused at the eatery, son? Why must I? The chap in the beard... Where are you?! They've both fled! But you're here... give me the money. But... - He has suffered losses... and you must compensate for it. - He's right. Do drop in everyday! I'll knock her teeth out if I get my hands on her! I've told you not to mess with girls. They don't have brakes... the accident is inevitable. Girls are trouble. They're a total loss... Shut up, smart-ass! And hurry. The girl's waiting for us. A girl again? - The heroine! Champakali! Hurry! We've got to reach Khanpur with her. "They're going to Khanpur from where you'll get a bus to Belapur" "Don't waste time. Go with them" Stop the truck, Shankar. - What for? I want to pee. My bladder's full. - No. The truck won't stop. What nonsense? Stop it! It's an emergency! No, I say! I will stop only at Khanpur now. Khanpur?! That's four hours away! My bladder will burst! Stop the truck, please! - No. You're at the wheels. So you act smart! Bloody... Watch it! It's worse on those pot-holes! What are you doing?! We drink from that! We won't anymore. - When are You going to change? Hand me the other bottle! Quick! Hurry! - You're a bloody animal! Didn't I say it'd burst? What an idea! We no longer have to stop the truck.

But you said there was no girl in the truck! It's like this; she was there when you saw her. We thought she wasn't there because we didn't find her there. But we realised that we thought she wasn't there, while she was! I can't understand this... She was there when I saw her? Yes, we thought she wasn't there. - Didn't you see her? But she was there! - Cut this crap of there and not! Are you trying to fool me? I'll have you thrown in the cell! What's his crime?

"My swaying hips... watch out, mister" There you go again! - Let's go. We're getting late! God's angry! I wonder who's going to take the lightning! This is Belapur! Who is it? - I'm Rupa. I'm Ram Singh's sister What're you doing here all alone? And where's Ram Singh? He's dead... he has been murdered! Don't cry, girl... come on inside. And thus, everything was destroyed. I have nothing left now! My brother was mercilessly killed. My little friend was murdered! They have inflicted many atrocities on us! All right... that's enough. Everything will be all right. I've come to you with great hopes. I expect you to help me! You are the one my brother had chosen for me, aren't you? The one who will protect me and be my companion for life? You will protect me and help me take revenge, won't you? You sure are a hot one! You're devastatingly beautiful. It's okay if you're a bit crazy. Listen... forget the past.

Show me the way, mother... Show me the way! Help me, Mother! C'mon! - Mother! C'mon, I say! - Let me go! Leave me alone! Stop the truck, smart ass! A girl's calling out to me! Shut up! Where would a girl spring from at this hour? Didn't I tell you not to even talk about girls? There! She knows you too! She's calling out to you! Kishan? Shankar? I hope it's not a ghost! Look there! On the steps of the temple! Damn those rotten... That's our heroine! And it's the cave-man she had stabbed at the show! I think this is serious! Stop the truck and... No! Why must we mess with a girl? Don't stop the truck... take a left, let's go. Help! Kishen! I think those beasts will rape her. They might even kill her. What do you think? ...but why must we bother? We won't mess with girls! Let's go! Don't stop the truck! It's okay if you've stopped... but let's not drive back. It's okay if you've driven back, but just don't step down! We mustn't mess with girls... - Shut up! He's gone! It's my turn now! Let me go! Hey, lady... leave her alone! "What are you scared of, when we're with you?" "What are you thinking about, silly girl?" Freeze! Cave-man! You want to play around with guns, eh? You're a dangerous man! Look, Rupa! "Your saviours were with you and you couldn't recognise them!" "They are the duo who will avenge your humiliation!" "This is the way the Goddess Mother has shown you" But why will they help you? "Nobody helps anybody without a good reason" "They will help you only when you forge relations with them" "Your beauty has always been a curse for you" "But now, it will be your greatest weapon" "Look at Kishen; the eternal romantic" "Cast the trap of love... and he'll fall into it" And look at Shankar... "The real friend, companion and comrade" "The combined strength of these men..." "will take you to your goal." What did you say? The girl's alive? Yes, Gujjar. She's alive! You're stupid and blind! Don't you remember? She fell off the cliff. But she has survived. Ask them, if you don't believe me. That's right, Gujjar. And you guys return empty-handed? Without her?! I had caught her, Gujjar. But she stabbed me and escaped! She gave me a wound! It's me she has given a wound to. A wound that hasn't yet healed. She's a hot one! My wound will heal only when I quench her fires! The butterfly! She will return to me! There are no explosives! There are apples in the crate! Look again! D'you want Blind bat! The explosives are under the apples and oranges! They're only fruits. - Look again. So you've bought fruits I had bought arms! Whom must I ask now? - Forgive me, Gujjar! Please! I think it's the girl's doing! She wasn't alone. She had the two boys with her! So the boys have found the girl, eh? If you love your life, Kali... you must find the explosives and the girl for me. I want both... both! Please trust me!

And I became an "export". Where did you learn it, Shankar? - His uncle was my father. All right. Stop spinning a yarn! He's jealous of me! - You have a unique friendship. Don't be formal with me. All right. I won't be formal with you anymore, Pyare. What did you call me? - Pyare (loved one). Say that again! Gawd! No one has ever called me that before! But I will call you that. Pyare... Will that do? - Of course. It'll do! Lt'll more than do! - Shut up! Don't take him seriously... You haven't told us your name! What's your name? My name...? - Think It over. Decide on a nice name. - Shut up! What's your name? Your name is Kishan. My God! You're flat and so's the tyre! We have a puncture. So come down to earth! Take the tyre and the standby. Go and get the puncture fixed. Why must I? You go on! It's your turn now. - Did you? All right. He's always scolding me... What's wrong with you? My stomach! It has a headache! - Your stomach has a headache?! Yes... - I know your excuses well! I'm speaking the truth! - All right. I'll go on. But you will take I might return at dusk. - Come in the night, no problem! Take your own time... we are in no hurry! I'll take care... what a buddy! I conned him, all right! Go on, Pyare... You were scared, Pyare! - Obviously! What joke is this? What if you had drowned? - So what? Drowning has its own fun... Damn it! You're very fond of drowning, aren't you? Is there anything wrong in drowning? - No... a bit of a danger, however. You're afraid of dangers. - I'm scared of nothing! Really? Aren't you scared of anything? So hold my hand, Pyare. - Think it over, lady! I won't leave the hand, once I've held it. How about holding it first? Damn it... C'mon, Pyare... C'mon! See? It isn't so easy to get hold of my hand! Really? Wait till I show you! Yes... but please let go. It hurts! Please let me go! Gawd! She's dangerous! I could die for you! But why are you staring at me? They've taken the goods and gone towards Haripur! What's the truck's licence number? What are their names? Kishan... and Shankar. Shankar! How are you, my friend? What's up? You've remembered How can you say that, chum? I'm always worried about you. So I've taken a decision today. 5,000? You've become a spendthrift You want money for clothes Must you treat me like a bank? - I treat you as my own, buddy. What's wrong with your body? You've lost weight! You used to look like a wrestler! All because we eat in the hotels... sleep at unearthly hours! This isn't any life, is it? We have no system at all! I want you to get a glass of lassi You must get pancakes for breakfast. As for lunch... you deserve the best of delicacies! Are you turning a cook? - Stop kidding! I want you to settle down. Yes. It's simple. With the money, I'll summon a priest... buy a mangalsutra and take the vows with a band playing for us. The moment I'm married, you'll be settled. I get it. You plan on getting Radha! - You nut! Are you crazy? It's 4 days since you've met That fraud of a girl... - Don't start that again! She respects you so very much. I won't spend a penny for Really? Is that decision final? - Absolutely final! Friends! Look at this man! Shankar Shahne! He calls himself my best friend! But he won't spend a penny on my welfare! Actually, it's more his welfare than mine! Who's going to drink the lassi? Him! Who's going to have the pancakes? Him! But he won't spend a penny! "I know my friends now... they've all drifted" Listen, clown! Put a silencer on your mouth! Take that! He's a real friend, you know! Bravo! The wedding's at the Shiv temple Go and hang if you wish to! I won't come to watch the farce! You will, of course. - No, I won't. You will, of course! I won't come, you jester! C'mon...! - Where Are We going? What are the new clothes and everything else for? You'll know in a moment. Is there a wedding? - Yes. Whose is it? - A bride and a bridegroom's. Who are they? C'mon! - I'm tired! Shankar! My friend! I knew you'd come! You couldn't keep away! C'mon! Shankar's here, Radha! How would I ever marry without Shankar around? Your marriage? Whom are you marrying? Shocked, aren't you? I'm marrying you, you silly girl! Who else? Come here and take a look! That band, the rose petals We're going to be one forever. - What joke is this, Kishan?! This is no joke... I will marry you, Radha. Really! Come... get started, priest. Wait... look at what I've got for you. Gawd! Aren't you beautiful?! What say, buddy? Sit down, darling... Sit down, Shankar. Start the ceremony, priest. She is an orphan like me. If there's anyone we have, it's my friend, Shankar. You will give Radha away, Shankar. No! What happened, Radha?! I can't get into this marriage. I can't marry! But... how can you We love each other! - I don't love anyone! I'm only capable of hating! But you're in love with me, Radha! - I had lied to you! That was a game I was playing! It was just a pretence! Let go of my hand! What did you say? You have You only toyed with him! I've never seen Kishan shed tears. I always found him laughing But you've made him cry today! Why? Why did you do it?! Tell me, or I'll wring your neck! Sure! Go ahead! But you can't kill the dead! You will only bury a corpse! Do you have the courage to know why I did that? So listen! My name is Rupa... not Radha. I'm from Chandanpur. I used to have a world of my own; I had my dear ones, too. Do you know what was This is my true story. I got a new lease of life only to destroy Gujjar Singh. The two of you are the You are the only ones who can lend strength... to a woman's frail arms. That's nature for you. And the Goddess's boon, too. You will help me... won't you? Lies! You are lying! You are lying! She's lying! She fabricates a new lie She gives us those sob-stories! She's a cobra! A cobra who stings hearts And she sets out to look Everything about her is a betrayal! You were right, Shankar! Women are unfaithful! She was toying with me... You've always wanted me to So take me away from her... Faraway... C'mon! No, Kishan! She isn't lying now. What? You're saying that? Yes! She's speaking the She spoke from the depths of her heart today. You have been subjected to But let me tell you something. God, who created this world... opens many doors for man, Even in the darkness of despair, We will tread the path God has shown you. We will help you. We will What're you talking about?! You're falling for her yarn?! She is a cheat! She's lying! It becomes our duty We must go with her, Kishan. I won't give her any help! I will go with her, This is what women are! They trap another, even as they stand exposed before one! What nonsense are you It's not only a husband or a lover who protects a woman. There's another facet to man... that of a brother! I'm your brother now, Rupa. You're not in your senses! Listen to me! Come along! Only Rupa will Very well. I'll go my way then. Never to meet you again! Think it over! You're breaking your relationship with me! No, friend. I'm not breaking any ties. He's leaving... stop him! Please stop him! Let him go. He won't stop now. I'm alive, Bulbul... Look, I'm alive! I know it. The whole village knows that you're alive. But... why have you returned? - Are you saying that, Bulbul?! Yes. Do you know what I mean? His men come here every day He has terrorised the village. If we don't hand you over to him... They'll set us afire! You don't know. We've been in mourning because Gujjar has been terrifying us. Why've you returned, dear? Go away, or else that You shouldn't have returned... Go away from this hell! Go on! No, teacher. Not to run away. How will you face him? - I'm here to destroy him! What are you blabbering about? You? You will take on the mighty Gujjar, will you?! Don't you know what Gujjar has said? He will kill us all We have nothing to do with your revenge, girl! This obsession of yours will spell doom for us! Not a word from you! Chief... throw her out! Please, Roopa... Go away. You're back, Rupa! You're back! Where is Gopal? ...where is he? The two of you have Stop it now... and tell me. Where've you hidden Gopal? Father! Gujjar's men They've come for you, Rupa! No! - Be sensible, Rupa. They must be carrying weapons. Go and hide, Rupa... Hey, chief! No, sir... we have no news! Tell us the truth, merchant! Or we'll set your shop on fire! No, sir... we have no news! I'll tell you...! I know it! Where is she? - She's mad, sir... I'll tell you! - Where is Rupa? First tell me where my son is. Where is Gopal? Do you want to know? Gujjar made a sieve out of... his little body! He's dead! Bitch! - No... Don't hit her, please! She's mentally ill! Those who inflict atrocities on And beasts that get out of control, ought to be shot! You're not hurt, are you? What have you done? What the hell have you done?! You have killed Gujjar's men! Rupa! What harbinger of death have you brought with you? Who's this man you've brought? - Haven't you recognised him? It's my brother, Ram! My brother, Ram! See? A stranger is willing to protect us! And you, our fathers and brothers, are squirming like cowards! I might not have the strength, brother. But I have the spirit. I'm with you! - You're not alone, Bulbul! I'm with you too! Women of this country are no less than men! Praise the women! Hear, hear! An army of eunuchs and women will now fight Gujjar! Shut up! Whom have you called an eunuch? Don't you think I'm a man? And what man are you! You can't save your own women and children... you'd rather wear those anklets and dance like eunuchs! What fools are you talking to? I swear it! They'll die the death of dogs! Let's get rid of the bodies, Chief. There're going to be many more. Do not lose hope, Rupa. When we arrived, there were just two of us. But we have found friends now. We had no guns... but we have some now. Our goal is not far away now. Yes. The goal is not very far. We're inching towards it. We're all here together... except him. "What have you done, Rupa? You've played with his feelings!" "Don't you know it's a sin to break someone's heart?" You have committed the sin "You have caused that carefree man a lot of anguish" "lmagine what he must be going through" "What sufferings must he be facing... all because of you" "But why must I think of all that? Why get carried away in emotions?" "Have I fallen in love... have I?" "Be it a heart or glass... it eventually break" "There's always a slip between the cup and the lip" Repeat! I want another bottle! Another bottle? Looks like you've been badly jilted! "It was with great humiliation that I left her place" I was always in love with her... and yet, she was unfaithful "Like the one whom the breeze ardently guards..." "how can anyone extinguish a lamp that the Lord protects?" Shake the Kutab Minar... if you can, O host If not, sit here with me... "have a couple of drinks and watch Kutab Minar sway" Fantastic! Excellent! Kishan Kumar, the actor! Not Pakoda Singh, my boy! It's Pakkad Singh! That's it, actually. What are you doing here? Where's your partner? "My friend is no longer a friend; my love is no longer my love" "I have nothing to do anymore except drink" And what are you doing here at the liquor-den, Pakoda Singh? It's Pakkad Singh! - Yes. That's right. I'm no longer an inspector. The Commissioner took my uniform away! He has suspended me! Suspended? What for? I locked up a guy thinking he was a terrorist. He turned out to be the Commissioner's brother-in-law! Really? You locked up his brother-in-law?! What'll you do now, Pakoda Singh? - Damn it! It's Pakkad Singh! I won't give up easily! I'll prove it to the Commissioner... that I can nab a real terrorist someday! Or I'm not Pakoda Singh! - Damn it! It's Pakkad Singh! Did I say Pakoda? - Yes. I'm going crazy! Should I get my hands on a terrorist like Gujjar Singh someday... I'll be a Commissioner directly! What was that? What was the name? Gujjar Singh! He killed a minister at Chandanpur some days ago. That's the one! - Gujjar Singh! Which means she spoke the truth! - Who spoke what? Where exactly is Chandanpur? - It's 500 kms. Away. Is Gujjar Singh a bandit? The Government has announced a reward of 10 million on his head. Now tell me something. Why did you sober down, the moment you heard of Gujjar? You don't know where he is, do you? Where is Rupa? Tell me! Speak up! Where is she? Let him go! Are you human, Godzilla?! To hell with you! Hey, actor! Save me from this monster! The bloody dino from Jurassic Park! Who the hell is he? - He's Gujjar's man. So I'm going to be promoted Where can I find Gujjar? - In Chandanpur village. So you have the address! Shut up! No one can stop me But I'm terribly hungry. - Eat the apples in the truck. Are you carrying apples? Excellent! This looks like a custard-apple! Great... Rupa! So you're back, eh? You have returned to destroy Gujjar! But where is your army? Let me see your army too! Sing glories of the Lord! Brother! Brother! Brother? You have yet another brother, do you?! Brother indeed! Give me the belt! Brother, are you? Won't you perform the duties of a brother then? Won't you get beaten up for your sister?! No... Don't! Brother, eh? - No! Don't hit him! Hang the bastard! Break his neck! Damn you, you bastards! Are you okay, Kishen? Show me your wound! What you did was worse than this wound! You walked out on me! What would've happened of you had I not come on time today? Nothing! Can anyone do harm to Shankar till Kishan is alive? I knew you would come! - Sure! You know everything! You're a smart-ass, aren't you? Bloody ass! You look beautiful, wrestler! What's your name? Bulbul. - Bulbul? Let's embrace! Come here... Nothing happens to me when I embrace you. Why do the bells ring when I embrace him? Inspector! What do you expect when you embrace a girl? Is she a girl? Really? - What else? Of course! - Bulbul! Entangle Pakkad! Sit here and take off your jacket. Show me the wound. It's okay. It's not serious. - But you've been shot! Let me see the wound... - Don't touch me! Try the false sympathy on someone else... it won't work on me anymore! You pretended to be in So you'd reach your goal and have your enemy at your feet? Okay. I'm crazy. And I will fulfill my duty as a lover. I will actually take you to your goal. But I will never look back at you again! And don't be under the illusion that I came here for you... no! I've come here for my friend... my best friend! He's lying! He has come here only for you, Rupa. I know him well! Know something? He possesses a heart of gold. You'll never find anyone like him again. I know, you're burning in the fires of hatred. But somewhere in your heart... you must give love a chance. Okay? ...Pyare! Listen! You pretended to love me so you'd find your goal! I'm crazy. As a lover I will fulfill my duty! I will take you to your goal. But I'll never look back at you again! Tell us! Where will we find Gujjar? Terrorists like us never stay at one place. Gujjar has no fixed place either. He keeps changing his place and disguises. He spends the night somewhere, and is elsewhere in the morning. You can't find Gujjar! He's a tiger you will find only when he's out hunting for prey. He's no tiger. He's a jackal in a tiger's garb. He attacks only when there is a crowd... not when someone's alone. He'll attack when there's a fair. - A fair? Should you want to hunt Gujjar down... you must again organise a fair in this village. A fair?! - Yes. Are you folks willing? They have rebelled, Gujjar! They have ignited the fire but their fires still aren't out! They're out to use our arms and ammunition against us! They built a higher effigy for you than that of Ravana... and made a sieve in it with bullets! Do you know what trap the fox has laid to trap the tiger? The fair! They will organise a fair in Chandanpur! There's going to be another fair in Chandanpur! A fair! The bastard is here! Gujjar has been hit! Let's go! Let's go! Don't let him escape! Get him! Don't let him escape! No! Don't, Gujjar! You are my enemy! Don't hit them! Don't! So whom will I thrash? Whom? You?! Gujjar, you coward! You raise your hand on a woman! Right! I mustn't hit a woman. No! Remember what I had told you, Rupa? You will never be anyone's sister again... nor anyone's wife! You'll only be a whore! My whore! No! No, Shankar... Brother! No! Don't! Let me go! No... - Well? A brother and a lover, eh? Your lover, isn't he? Hang the bastard! The lover boy! And the love! You value your chastity, lady, isn't it? And you even staked your life for that! I want to see now... if your honour is more precious than your love! Your love it is! - Gujjar! No! I'll have your blood, you swine! Leave her alone! That's love! No! Brother! Brother! Praise the Lord! See, Gujjar? You are at my feet. I have won, Gujjar... and you have lost! Because it's always God who triumphs... not the devil! You said I'd never find a brother! Here's my brother! He has returned for good! You also said I could never be anyone's wife! You are wrong, Gujjar! You have been proved wrong! Here's my man! Yes, Kishan! I say this today in front of my enemy... and my village! You're the only one I have loved! But you hate me now... don't you? What I did with you was very bad! No human being has the right... to toy with another's emotions to reach his goal and destination! Because one has borne atrocities... must one inflict injustice on another? You had said you'd lay my enemy at my feet! But you'd never look back at me again. I won't stop you either. But once... just once... ...tell me that you have forgiven me!
