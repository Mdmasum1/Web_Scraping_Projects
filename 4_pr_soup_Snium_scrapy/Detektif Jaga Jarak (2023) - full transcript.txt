foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Loyalty is a principle. Cheating is a habit. I'm skeptical that my husband is cheating on me. I came here because I need proof. We need one week's time and within that time frame,... ...all the evidence will be sent via email. Can I get the evidence, Mr..... Jon. Call me Jon. My names not actually Jon. Its Almond. Like the name of that nut. Like the ones for donuts or the ones for milk. A few months ago. I used to be a marriage consultant. Since the pandemic, married couples have been more... ...at home which leads to more arguments. You'd expect this to get me more income,... ...but instead its just getting deserted. My brother Teddy, said, give online counselling a shot. So you won't lose against the established counsellors. Yes, he said I should keep up with the trends. I've been working and crashing on the second floor of... ...Boriss law firm. Boris is Teddy's boss. Hes practically sick of me by now because I haven't been able to... ...pay my deposit for the firm. Now, let me ask you again. When was the last time we got money from you? Right here, see? Almond Surendra. How many years ago was that, Almond? I feel bad for Teddy. He is always covering for me. I have not choice but to go around and knock on doors... ...to get new clients. Once I actually got one but he asked me to get his wife's... ...permission to get married again. Judging by the situation, I don't think you can marry again. I told you. It's impossible to speak calmly to her. This is Mr. Yahya, the husband. You liar! You're practically calling each other baby. Thats Mrs. Yahya, the wife. Hey! My name actually is Baby. This is the kite thats about to break. Shut up, you tramp. I've already told your husband several times already. If he wants to be with me he needs to tell his wife first. I'm not the one who wants trouble. So I said..... I think its best if you don't continue, sir. Your first marriage is way more valuable than... ...satisfying a momentary desire. And they stopped. Before the counselling was over Boris wants to collect the payment. Oh, sir. About the invoice. Do you want me to print it now..... I don't want to pay. This wasn't what we agreed on. So you only want to pay, when you get your second wife? Is that it? Nowadays, don't even think about other people. We never know, if we're going to be in trouble tomorrow. When are you going to propose to my daughter? Next year, sir. -Oh my goodness. The only news I received in my group chats are people dying. Many relatives have passed away. We never know how long we have. It's possible that I won't be here by next year. Papa. -It can't be too long, Almond. My daughter will be rusty by then. I want to have grandchildren. If possible, I want a boy. She is my only daughter. Honey, what's wrong with you? Not everything can be rushed. These are all potential husbands for Arum, who can be rushed. That are already able to provide. Mama -Arum, enough. He's a consultant, but he doesn't have a certificate. What can you expect from him? He might not even have a vaccine certificate. It's not like that Mrs..... -Sorry, Almond. Arum, everyone in this list have salaries over IDR 15 million. Don't settle for less like I did before. Don't spread it everywhere, dear. What I meant was, marrying someone who is rich isn't easy either. There are a lot of temptations. -Mama. It's all right. I am going to wait for Almond. Almond. The men in here are all very serious. They all don't want to take too long. They're all ready in three months. Are you ready in three months? I'm ready, ma'am. Okay. Then I'll be waiting for your proposal. Hon, when did you gather this? Hon, you don't want to get married again do you? The wedding will be online,... ...but there has to be an actual wedding too. There are 50 invitations. -Isn't that expensive? Do you need me to lend you the money? No, no. It has to come from me. Ted. What's wrong? He wants to split it instead of having to pay for you here. He wants to take all the capital. All of it? That means..... -I won't have an office anymore. No, no way. I'll just leave. Where are you going to go? -Don't think about me. I'm okay. Oh, Ted. Ted, it's fine. -Please just take it. Ted, I don't want trouble you. -You are already trouble, Almond. I know you don't have much right now. Just use it for rent, or for transport, or whatever. Later when you have extra money, pay me back. Thank you. Mr. Mayor? Sir, I wanted to ask. Is this job vacancy still available? This ad was from a year ago. Oh. What about the others? They're available, but they are voluntary jobs. Are you interested? I am, but not voluntary. Oh, if you have a PPE suit and a disinfectant spray,... ...you can be the Disinfectant Sprayer for the neighbourhood. Once you spray, you get IDR 100,000. 100,000 for one house? -No, one neighbourhood. Not bad, in one week you can get two or three times. Interested? All right sir. I'll look for the equipments first. Sir, sir. I have another question. During lockdown, is the office closed? Of course. -Is it okay if I stay here? Of course but I'll deduct your salary, okay? Later you'll..... What is your name again? Almond. Right, Almond, you'll be sleeping in Ujang's room. All right. Not mine. Oh. That's mine. Hello? Yes love. Okay love. Almond, you don't have to think about what my parents said, okay? It's okay for you to propose later. I want to find a job first. I want to be independent. It's okay, love. I've accepted. Just pray for me. But I don't want you to feel like you're being forced. I don't. I have a new job now. I'll propose in three months. I promise. Ma'am, I'm done. Babe, wait! Be careful. What are you looking at? I'm pissed. Hey! This wasn't our deal. Here you go. If I may ask, why are you getting divorced? Because there's a third person, Mr. Dadang. What's a third person, dad? Mr. Mayor, sorry I have to leave. After you, sir. All right, sir. Almond. Almond. There's been 11 cases since the beginning of the year. Those who get along, get along. Those who don't get along, don't. What about you, Mr. Mayor? Those who get along, get along. Those who don't get along, don't. Take care of the office. I've got something to take care of. Almond. -Yes. Clean this up later. I need to go now. Okay. Be careful, sir. Ma'am. Who are you? I'm Mrs. Murni. Mr. Dadang's wife. You're the one staying here right? Just shut up. You don't have to know everything. My husband relapsed. Instead of working from home, he has wandered off. I can't take it anymore. I'm going to prove it, he's been seeing another woman. I'm embarrassed with the kids. They have all grown up now. One is getting married. The younger one likes watching people get married. The father's hobby is getting married. Ma'am if you find evidence, what are you going to do? It depends, what's the evidence? What do you know? Nothing. -What? Admit it! What do you know? It doesn't have to be this way, ma'am. I am tired. I don't want to live like this. Actually ma'am, your husband has a phone in that table... ...but the drawer's always locked. What's the password? Our anniversary. His birthday. My birthday. First child's birthday. Second child? First day of lockdown. International Trash Day? -When is that? I don't know. -You're trash. How many numbers? Four. 3838? Did it work? Ma'am, take some time to think it over. Sometimes it's best if we don't know. I've pretended not to know for 22 years! Ouch! Slowly. You didn't fall, did you? -No. I was slapped by the devil. Loyalty is expensive. It can't be found in worthless people. Actually, I was the one who told Mrs. Murni about your phone. Oh no. I'm sorry. Oh well. It was bound to happen. It doesn't matter how she found out. She found out anyway, right? Sorry, sir. It's fine. This is a bad example. Don't follow my steps. Please help with the administration here. The forms are there, on the shelf. Keep the stamp in my drawer. Then if anyone comes by, just help them out. Okay? Where are you going, Mr. Dadang? I want to give it a serious shot over there. Who knows? I need a neighbourhood report. I need to make a health declaration letter. Okay ma'am. Wash your hands first. Here's my ID card. Ma'am! Here's the photo. Is it clear enough? Takdir, if you show me her face, I'll pay you more. Take the phone back. Can you do it? -Of course. Excuse me, is it done? -Yes, it's done. Here you go. Where's my ID? Hey, kid. Kid. Kid, come here. What do you want? -Come here. Out of all these cases, how many are you involved in? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't act all brave with me, kid. Hey. You have to stop following people. Their marriage is none of your business. Do you understand? Then what do I eat? Just look for another job. All right then. Hand this over and you find another job. You don't have to tell people what to do. You're struggling to feed yourself as it is. Hello? Almond, I'll be waiting for you to drop by today. All right, ma'am. Sorry ma'am, but don't I have three months? You do, if you're employed. They said you're unemployed. Wait, where'd you hear that from? From Mr. Unaged. He heard it from Boris... ...when he was taking care of his inheritance. Don't listen to him, ma'am. All you have to know is that in three months,... ...I'll propose to Arum. Along with the venue, the catering, and the dowry. All of that, ma'am. Almond, where are you going to get the money from? Are you going to rob the bank? I think I am not wrong in prioritising my daughter,... ...because Arum's future must be clear. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too, Wisnu. You get here pretty quick. Yes ma'am. Almond, you may leave now. Oh, okay ma'am. Hi. What's going on here? Why is it so crowded here? Arum, this is Wisnu. He is my friend's son. I want to introduce him to you. Oh, right. Mom, I told you I mind. It's just an introduction, there's nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with it, but Almond's right here! Hi. So you're just going to stand there and not do anything about it? No, but just now..... There's nothing wrong with getting to know each other. Hi, I'm Almond. Wisnu, have a seat. Your daughter's fierce. I like her even more. Arum. Hi. -I'm disappointed. Very. I'm sorry. I should've told you I was unemployed. That's not the problem, Almond. Then what's the problem? You're being treated this way, but you stay quiet about it. You're not defending us. You're not even defending me. I mean, what was I supposed to say? Yes ma'am, just relax. Even though my job is a mess, Arum will be happy with me. I can't say that. It's not like that. Mom? -Yes, Arum? Tell the guests to leave, please. I'm not in the mood to meet anyone right now. Arum, don't be like that. You can leave too. Boris! Why did you tell Arum's dad that I was unemployed? I was the one that brought them to you. Well, what was I supposed to say? They were asking, where is Almond? Almond doesn't work here anymore. Then where is he? I don't know! Why'd you come here anyway? To protest? -No. To fight? -Well, no. Then why are you here? -I am just annoyed. Here's what we're going to do. I think it's best if you leave... ...before I lost my temper. Get out! -Boris, Boris. Boris, let me talk to Almond. Whatever! Lets be realistic, Almond. You need to find some money first. Money doesn't always make you happy but it makes our lives easier. Okay babe, bye. -Bye. Hi! -You forgot your bag. Oh right, bye! -Bye. Be careful, see you. Sir, do my house as well please. I can give you proof. What proof? -Proof about your husband. Hey, you don't mess around with me. I will report you to the police. Niken Yurini ma'am. I swear to God If hes with that girl again..... Ma'am. Keep your distance, ma'am. Fine, where's the evidence? Well, I can't give it to you for free. So I have to pay? How much? 1 million? 2 million? 2 million is fine, ma'am. Let me see it first. Why'd you steal my client? I don't know what you mean. Heres proof. My job is to spray. Okay, I admit I've lost. Let's just work together. What do you mean? Work together. We'll split the profit. You'll be doing the field work. -Okay. You'll give the evidence to the client. Okay. 80:20 -60:40. 70:30, I'll feed your dog. All right. This is the boy, this is the girl. It must have happened during the day and in the parking lot. Now whenever he puts his phone down, it's always face down,... ...not with the screen faced up. He just started using a password too... ...and he changes it from time to time. Maybe it's her first time. Let's just charge 2 million. I just wanted to pay back my debt. Dir. Do everything you can to get evidence,... ...but don't break any laws. Almond, why are we only snooping for a week? What if we reach eight sessions? Then what happens? The male libido only lasts between three to five days,... ...but a girl's lasts between five to seven days. Libido? What's libido? Is this the guy? Oh. Yes, thats him. Yes. Dir. Now, this is the administrative officer. If you need any citizen's data just ask him. That's Ms. Citra, from the police. Now shes the neighbourhood police. Neighbourhood police? How do you mean? Making sure residents follow covid protocols and no crowding. Mrs. Murni, do you mind if I use one of the benches here for work? Yes of course. I'm glad that theres a police officer now. That one's better ma'am, because there's a little crack. Almond, right? -Yes. Why do you live here? -This is only temporary, ma'am. I've also asked permission from the mayor and he agreed,... ...but in return, I have to do all the administrative work... ...in the office. Public facilities are not private facilities. Where did you live before? At Nirwana Shophouse. Got kicked out by the owner because you were renting with no income? That's right, how'd you know? If you provide disinfectant services now... ...that means your previous work didn't do so well. Since it didn't do so well, it became a burden. Renting a shophouse isn't cheap. Do you live alone here? Yes, just me. If so, don't stay here too long. If the lockdown is over, look for other places to stay. All right. These are the ones that separated from their family cards this month? Yes, and below that is..... Everythings here. Is it really this many? Yes. If it is, let me copy it first. All right. What are we going to do, Almond? -Oh, it's you. Stay away from her, Dir. It's up to you if you want to see or not,... ...but my job here is done. Pay up! Charity accepted. Angel heading to heaven. Hurry up, brat. Hold on, is that your boss? Tell him I want to talk. Give him the phone, Dir. Talk. He is listening. I'm not strong enough to open it. What if it hurts Thats not my problem. Thats not my problem. I still love her, so much. Like really in love. We were just planning on having a baby. Can you help me patch things up with her again? Just do whatever you can with the other man. Kidnap him or whatever. I'll pay again, it's fine. Leave, Dir. -Leave, Dir. I meant you, you leave. You, you leave. You leave. -You. Me? I leave? Takdir, you leave. Oh. Okay, Almond. I thought you got smarter. We shouldn't get too involved,... ...or else its going to come back at us, Dir. All right, come back. Ma'am. Mr. Almond. -Yes? Yesterday there was another fight because her husband was caught... ...cheating and there's photo evidence too. Oh no. This photo was taken by a fake investigator. That means someone has been going in and out of this neighbourhood... ...pretending to be a detective. I've already tried investigating... ...but residents said there was nothing suspicious besides... ...a disinfectant sprayer with a pink hazmat suit. Can I check your room? But ma'am,... ...it's really messy, I haven't cleaned it up yet. Thats all right. -No, but it's really messy. Its all right. Smells like a bachelor. -It's all right. Sorry its a bit messy, ma'am. That's the mayor's. That's his collection. I need to see your phone gallery, Almond. Shouldn't there be a warrant? Thats basically violating my privacy. According to Law Number 8 of 1981 Criminal Code,... ...I have the authority to seek information and evidence. If you are not willing to cooperate,... ...my further action is to make this difficult for you. Yes. I don't want to be hassled. I'll hold on to it, ma'am. She's quite pretty. When will you marry her? Just pray for us, ma'am. Yes, it smells like a bachelor. Dir. Dir. Bro? Dir. Your dog was making noises. No. It's his petting time. Its hard with her around. -Yes, it is. Maybe we should just move somewhere else. I feel like your mistress always hidden. I don't know where to go. Where do we go? Every time I leave, she always asks. Where are you going? If you can, just do it online. Hows our second client? The wife said he changed. He doesn't talk anymore, always fighting,... ...arguments here and there. -La la la? She said its been a week. Ok, just follow him wherever he goes. He comes home, take a photo. Write down the address. If for example he comes to a hotel or to an apartment,... ...take a photo of them until they reach the front door. Okay? -Are you crazy? I might as well just hand myself over to the police. Our client needs strong evidence. Something to do with child custody. Okay, give me operational rights. I want to book a room. No way. -Yes, way. Yes ma'am, just a minute. Almond. When the fun is over, please help me move the table. Yes ma'am, sorry. I don't want to go back again. I just want to pay off my debt. I want to propose to Arum, You'll accompany me right? Is it for real? Its been for real for a long time. The money wasn't though. Dir, later when you've reached your target,... ...we should stop. -Jeez, Almond. Only arrogant people refuse blessings. How am I going to explain it to Arum and her parents... ...when we're married? Almond. Yes? May I help you? You're Almond? -Yes. Don't pretend to be so close with Citra. Do you understand? -I am not. I mean, you're just guarding the office. Why are you dressed up? No, bro. This..... I'm going to my girlfriends house. Talk again and I'll beat you up. Is that what you want? Sorry, sorry. You promised you wouldn't come here. I already told you dear, it's better for you to work... ...in forensics. Work with corpses. The corpse won't bother you, honey. Unlike him! Go ahead, I still have to be here. But babe,..... -Please. Okay. Remember, Citra is my fiance. Don't you dare mess around. I'm sorry about all this. Think it over, ma'am, if you want to get married. Thank you. We have accepted the intentions you brought over. Have you got the money? Yes. However, the decision still rests with Arum. How do you feel, Arum? I..... Can I have time to think about it? I thought you were ready, Rum. I am, I just need time. Maybe, you want to see the other candidates again? Mom. How about it, Almond? Are you still willing to wait? I think it's best if we eat first. Hon? Alright, let me prepare it. Arum, help your mother. When will you get married? I'll let my brother go first,... ...so that the younger brother can learn from him. Lets take a selfie! Sure. -Lets just use Arums phone. Her camera is way better. Do you want me to call Arum? No its okay, lets take one of just the boys. Can you use it? Yes, sir. All right, engagement! Ted, help me out over here, Ted. Engagement. -Engagement! Everyone can give love. Not everyone can be loyal. That's a sign of cheating, Almond. You're the one who told me. Yes, but this is Arum. So what if its Arum? Is she loyal? Only dogs are loyal. What did he say? He said, that's right. If this is the case, you know what we have to do, right? No, no, no, no, no. I have to deal with this the right way. She's playing you. Why would you be nice anyway? -She's not cheating on me. Watch your mouth. Try video calling her. If she doesn't pick up, then shes playing you. Hello? Hi love. What are you doing? Nothing much. What's wrong? Nothing. I just wanted to ask. We're okay, right? What do you think? I mean..... Look, actually I really wanted to admit my mistake. I used your phone to take a selfie with your dad and Teddy. Then I realized you use a password now. Are you doing anything weird? Almond. You saw yourself this afternoon, my nieces were visiting us. They're very naughty, they kept playing with my phone. Of course I put a password on. Okay. Why are you so suspicious? My password is seven, six times. I mean, I don't need to know. No You're accusing me of something, right? I mean, it's fair to assume so. When I proposed you didn't say yes right away. Well, you were being annoying. Okay. Lets stop and forget the past. Do you want to tell your parents... ...that you accept my proposal I don't know. Give me time. All right then. All good, Almond, shes not cheating on you. You're just an asshole. The characteristics of a cheater, no. 33. If accused, she will get angry. Why is she angry? Her adrenaline is going up. Why is it going up? Because she's afraid. Afraid of being caught. I have to follow Arum Woah Almond, you're involving your feelings into this. Let me do it. Don't break your own rules. This is from a resident, someone took the photo. It's not too clear. Bro, remind me, okay? When I grow up, don't fall in love. Love is bullshit, it makes the brain useless. What did he say? -That's right. Can't he say anything else? How is it? Its enough, Mrs. Murni. Mrs. Murni. -Hey! Ma'am, I'll leave my child with you again, okay? Come here. It's all right. Sorry to be a bother again, ma'am. -No worries. Bro. You'll lure the person out. Then when she's out, I'll take a photo. Clear? Let's go. She's still dealing with the divorce. Her husband left the house. He's no longer supporting them. She's forced to work now. Oh, so cute. Whose dog is this? Hello. Look at his face. He's so cute, I just want to take him home. By the way, if you get rejected, you can give me her number? What? Sue me. Lets go home. -Bro, bro. Excuse me, sir. Open the door please. What is it, kid? Thats my dog, I want to take him back. Your dog? -Yes, he is my dog. Prove it. -Bro, Bro. Bro. Come here. -Where? He just doesn't want to right now, but thats my dog. That's enough, get lost. -Please don't. Brat! -Give him back please. Bro, bro. Hey! What are you doing? What the hell is this? Taking photos of me are you? I'm sorry I'm sorry. -Give it to me! Oh. Wow. Are you a spy? Is this how you make money? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It hurts, bro. I'm taking you to the police, You're done. Boris. Just let him go. Just let him go, poor thing. Hes just a kid. I'll tell you what. No one messes with Boris. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll take your photo. There. I'll take photos of your face. I'll put it up at the police station. Enough! -I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Go. What are you doing here, Almond? What am I doing here? What are you two doing here? I'm taking care of dads inheritance, he asked me to. He's sick. Then why didn't you do it at the office? Teddys using the office for an interview with a new client. Limited capacity. You worked out all the answers, huh? You're dressed up more than usual. Of course, I have an interview after this. I've already told you that I wanted to find a job. When? Oh my god. Here. Here's the power of attorney from Mr. Unaged for Arum... ...to take care of the inheritance. Done? Satisfied? I'm just being careful, theres nothing wrong with that. No, what are you careful of? Now its my turn to ask. What are you doing here? Okay. Boris, I don't hav anything else to sign, do I? No. Thats all. Thank you. -Thank you, Boris. Arum, Arum sweetie. Arum, wait. Wait, I can..... I can explain. -You're so annoying. You paid someone to follow me and he's just a kid! Its not like that, I can explain. What else is there to explain? It's all clear now. You don't trust me. So whats the point in us trying? Wait, just try to listen to me. Enough. Ugh, enough. Where are you going? Just tell the kid to follow me again. Almond. Shes just upset. Just wait for her to cool down, then you two can get back together. Its different this time, Dir. Shes never been like that before. Should I just come clean? With her parents too? About everything we've done? For what? Well, if I want to start a family, I can't hide anything. I need to be honest. I think we need to stop, Dir. I mean, think about it. All I do is take care of affairs. I ended up doing the same thing to my significant other. Acting suspicious, accusing her of things. Its not healthy, man. What about me? What if we get a client? Relax. I've thought about it. I think its time you find a new job, Dir. A better one. Here. Some capital. Just use it for your business. Not cool, Almond. I can do everything myself. She's not here. I don't know where she went. She didn't even say goodbye. Yes, mom? Where did you go? You left without saying goodbye. I'm still at my job interview. I'm coming home in a bit. Always at interviews. All right then, be careful. Okay. Okay, thanks ma'am. Almond. Think your relationship through. Are you sure you can make my daughter happy? She said she'll be here, Bro. Just hold on. She promised lots of cash if we could do it. We don't need Almond. Here. Come on. Do you want to high five again? High five. Takdir? Mrs. Helena? Listen, kid. You can get mixed up in a lot of laws because of your stunt. The penalty can be pretty harsh. Go ahead. I'm a minor. Thats true, minors are usually fostered,... ...but the problem is your beloved dog can lose his owner... ...and be taken to a shelter. Bro, as soon as this is over, I will come looking for you. When you grow up, just join the force. Don't work like this again. Excuse me, here. Is he handcuffed? He just did it on his own. Jon? Isn't this in the mayors office? Is it for real? Ted, help me out over here. -Engagement! I just need time. Teddy? Teddy? Open the door! -I'm not feeling well. How come? I don't know, I've had a fever since yesterday. I think its Covid. -Oh, yes? Open up. Let me check your temperature. -I don't want to. Open up! -No! If you don't open the door, I'm breaking it down. Do it. -Arum! Arum, come out! -No! Just stay there. Arum, you know me. I would never get mad. Ted, open up Ted. -Really? Really? I swear. Open. First of all, Arum and I..... Teddy! Teddy, enough! Teddy, enough! This is dangerous! Let him go. Let him go. I can't believe you, Ted. Almond. If you failed, just fail bro. Teddy! Ted. You'll pay for this, bro. Dir. I was right. Turns out, Arum was cheating on me. With my own brother. How could she? Where are you? So you paid the price. How'd you know? Takdir. Let him go, ma'am. Hes not in the wrong. If you want justice, just take me instead. You didn't break any laws. Your chats with Takdir are one way. I can't use it as evidence. You work clean. Why did you do all of this, Almond? Are you planning on doing it again? If so, I'll find a way for you to get arrested. What You're doing is destroying peoples homes. You don't know the effects it has on them,... ...their families and their children. They're supposed to find their own answers to their marriage. What You're doing has no benefit. Whats this? Your fiance likes to shop lately. Hes insecure because hes afraid you would do... ...the same thing hes doing. There's no use. I will never believe you. Are you sure? His lucky number is 26, your fiances regular girl. My work has benefits after all, right? Don't worry, this ones on me. Liar! Read the command. Almond Surendras arrest for the mistreatment of Teddy Surendra. Huh? Ma'am. My father once said that all men are the same. They will always end up unfaithful. All women must accept it, unconditionally. So its up to par with the heartbreak, just find... ...someone who is nice and substantial. Can you imagine? They don't even know what they're going to eat tomorrow,... ...but instead they get cheated on. Is your father a loyal man? My mom was the second wife. My grandfather also had two wives. It takes time... ...but there are definitely good people out there. Good? Aren't the good ones the ones who ends up betraying you? Thats where it hurts, right? Its going to be all right. I'm saving up, don't worry. This time its for us. Don't use it for social assistance, mask production, or whatever it is. Okay? Ted, I don't want to trouble you. -You're already trouble. I'm really sorry, Almond. She saw a photo of our office. Its not your fault, Dir. Dir, when you're older, think twice about getting married. Not everyone is strong enough to feel betrayed. Don't worry, Almond. I'm not getting married. I don't get it though. Why would people get married? They're just going to slide anyway. My baby. Thank you! You must be responsible This is all your fault! No. 26? I don't get it either. Hi, babe. Babe, how'd you know I was here? May I borrow your phone? Heres the thing, let's talk about this. Phone, babe. Okay babe, phone. Theres lipstick on your lip. Babe, babe, babe. You still remember... ...the talk we had about privacy, don't you? Of course you remember. Right? Babe, Citra. Love. I can explain. I was influenced by my friends. They said I should satisfy myself before I get married,... ...and stuck with you You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. Let Takdir go, and Bro too. I was wrong. Just arrest me. They're not guilty. Tell him to join the police academy. Did you hear that Dir? Whatever, Almond. What matters is that I'm out. Follow me. Let me process it. Let's go. Me? -Yes. Almond. There is no force more powerful than the anger of the most... ...patient person,... ...and the disappointment of the most loyal person. Almond, I asked Teddy to help not prolong this case. So he could lift his charges. Teddy has agreed. I also want to apologize to you. But Teddy and I, we really didn't do anything. Almond, we met because I asked him to. I wanted to open up to him. I wanted to be honest with you but I was afraid You'd be like this. How long has it been? He confessed that he liked me since you introduced me to him... ...but I've never responded. Okay, this past year hes chatted with me a lot. He sent me gifts. At first I didn't respond but after a while..... After a while? He defended me when you didn't. He always prioritised me. And you..... You've never even prioritised yourself. So you rejected my proposal because of Teddy? I'm sorry. I..... It's fine. Almond. -I understand. At this point, I should vent. Like a sunset lover venting to the sky,... ...but what do I want to talk about? You already know what happened. You already know how I feel. What you might not know, is what I am about to do next. Although maybe some of you might have guessed. Left of right? Left? Bro? You're such a drama queen, Almond. Is that all you got? It's all over, Dir. What else am I supposed to do? If you jump, you won't even die, Almond. Really? If your brothers being an asshole, just kick him far away. What the hell, Almond? Hug me. What is this, Almond? -I need this, hug me. Please do this. For me. -What are you doing, Almond? Dir, when we get out of here,... ...lets open a pre-marriage counselling business. To help people so they don't make the wrong choices. Wheres the money in that, Almond? They wouldn't even have time for counselling. They're already rushing to get married, you know? What do you know, kid? Wait here, I'll get my things. So, you two made up? Yes, but now I'll look after him,... ...so he doesn't mess around anymore. Over there. Almond, Almond. Can I have your number? Sure, thing. Write it down. Thats our client, Almond. The one who asked you to kick his mistress out. We shouldn't interfere, Dir. Everyone just has their own journey. Dir, starting from today, we're splitting the profit 50:50. I'll support you and Bro. Deal? Deal. A few months later. Can I help you? I think my husband is cheating on me. I came here because I need proof. You didn't have to come here. You can do everything online. Thats true. We need one week and within that time frame,... ...all the evidence will be sent to you via email. Our payment system is 50:50. 50% now and 50% after the evidence is delivered. I also want to apologize to you, Almond. Jon. Call me Jon. -I am sorry. How can you be so cold? Just being professional. Are you sure you can get proof? I know your husband very well. Relax. -That's true. Okay. Jon. If you were given the chance to get back together,... ...would you want to? When are they coming? Probably ten more minutes. Bro, come here. You said ten more minutes. -How was I supposed to know? Hurry up. I called the guy, but he never showed up. What guy? You're a con guy. Ma'am. Ms. Citra. All right, everyone. We have got the address. We need to move now before they get away again. We were bugged again. Is this your dog? Yes. -Cute dog. Thank you. Your dogs cute too. Whats his name? My name is Takdir. I meant the dog. -That's Bro. Hello Bro. What's your name? Love. -What? Love?
