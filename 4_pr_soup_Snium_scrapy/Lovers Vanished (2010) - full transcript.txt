Worst magic show on earth Do you believe us? Watch carefully! When will you teach me tougher magic? When you learn everything, you'll be tired of me. You think? What? That I can ever be tired of you? Think that day will ever come? How can you be so attractive? So charismatic. And sometimes cute. Mia. Mia...We can't. No... Mia. I shouldn't. Please. Condom. Condom! Sang-byung! I'm so worried about Mia. I'm being careful. Being careful won't solve it! If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't be living like this. Yeah, we wouldn't. - Should we be thankful? - Sang-byung! Sang-byung! Come and eat! It's time for breakfast! Let's go. Mia! Mia! Mia! Mia... Mia! Gun shop What are you doing! Who do you love? Calm down. Tell her, Sang-byung. Who do you love? Mia... Who do you love! Who do you love? Stop it! What a relief. I'll die from a gunshot rather than this shitty disease. Mia, please forgive Sang-byung. Say it! Who do you love! Go on! Say it! Please... Stay back! Jin-ho... Police station Hey, escapin' champ! Get over it. It's been years, man. Forget it. Son of a bitch. Sorry. Something you want from me? The dirt's so soft and fine. It's not true, is it? What is? If you have AlDS, you can get out of here? Like who? The magician? Everyone knows he's getting out. Why do you ask? I think it was at another prison. A guy got discharged for that. Everyone was busy avoiding him because he had AIDS but now that he's getting out, they're all envious. Wanna play basketball or pick a fight? Thought I'd pick up magic. You're the one who escaped last year and got caught, right? The infamous fugitive, that's me. You want this ball? Think that's a trick or real? How'd you do that? It looks real. If you want you must tell the difference. Looked pretty real. I'll teach you how to disappear from the world. Follow me. See me? You wanna disappear from here? Try it. How are you holding up? I'm okay. I'm getting married, soon. She wanted to come, but something came up. Hey, bro... Yeah? Did you find where that bastard moved to? I thought this was over. It's not, bro! Su-in...It's over. Everyday is a living hell for me. How long you in for? Pretty long. For life. Been bad, huh? So, what did you do? They say I killed my wife. I killed my lover. Guess that makes you worse. Anything you crave being stuck in here? Sometimes I crave oyster gratin. I need to eat more protein. Oyster gratin... Get bechamel sauce and cheese with your magic and I'll make it. Were you a chef? Only one customer tried my food and didn't become a regular. My wife's lover. When are you leaving? Who says I am? If you help me... That was good. My whole life... I can't waste it in here. It's been 4 years. Why do you think I'm still here? You get discharged for AlDS only when you die. What? What the hell are you saying? You mistook being hospitalized for getting out. Bastard. Joking at a time like this. For real? Are you sure? You're lying! You'll soon understand... How stupid it is to do this to someone like me! Su-in. You know it's hard to last 3 years being infected through blood? That long? Damn! What if I get infected! Be quick! So you say you can cook? A little. Enough chit chat. Get me a lot of colorful paper when you come back in. I don't want to part with you... But with the right chance, it's possible. There's a woman named Mia at cafe Le Luth in Namryangpo. If you succeed, please meet her once. Your wife? No. Girlfriend? No. Sorry, I'll be busy. Want me to tell her how you're doing? No, tell me how she's doing. I want to know. If I make it... You know what disease I have, right? Think about it in my shoes. With not much time to live, would you go back in there? Let...go. Shoot. But don't get my blood on you. It'll be okay. Trust in God's grace and mercy and make your confession. It's my first confession. I'm listening. Please begin. I'll kill you! I'm sorry! I wanted to visit you and such, but I was scared! We met right before I became a priest. So? So... It's wrong, but I couldn't resist the temptation and... And what? I gave into the temptation. A priest shouldn't give into Satanic temptations! So? So I repented and lived as a son of God. But then she came to me again... And then? She said if I didn't love her, she'd tell everyone. So that's why you killed her? No...it was accidental. It was an accident. She was pregnant. She said it was mine. What should I do with you? I'll go to the police and tell them everything. Hey, stop! Stop right there! That feels great. Have fun, Mia! Come by to eat, later. My cooking tastes way better! I brought some chips. This is a suicide prohibited area. Please go elsewhere. This is a suicide prohibited area. Please go elsewhere. Thank you. I can't serve meals right now. The chef ran away. If you're really hungry, I can make some sushi rolls. Though people who eat them seem to get diarrhea. A Singapore Sling, please. Yes. Hello. No. I can't. But can you cook? Over here! Yes? Can you make a Wellford salad, ravioli, and flounder steak? The ingredients aren't the best. Hey, who's that? You finally found a chef? Extended stay You'll pick out the stuff, right? No. Oh, god! What was the name? LlM Eugene. I meant the name of this. Cod Meuniere in Rose Sauce. I wish I was the only one who gets to eat this. I've been dying to hear from you. Are you okay? I'm fine. How's your health? My throat hurts a bit. Thought of... turning yourself in? But I didn't do anything wrong. The police came by often, but not much these days. Should I go and tell them the truth? It's useless. Just complicate things more. I tried, already. It was no use. Chef Eugene won't run away like the last chef, right? Well...we'll see. Is Eugene married? Why? You like him? Ask him yourself. Dong-yul! That looks great. Aren't you hunting these days? No. A new gun came in. Wanna see it? No. It's really awesome. Mia! Hello? I got tired and came straight home. Could you close up for me? Did you have dinner? I don't feel like it. Sorry to make you eat, alone. You work at the cafe? I'm Cho. I live in town. If you get tired of fishing, how about hunting with me? I'll just stick to fishing. Have fun fish hunting, then! Let's go! Let's go! Dong-yul! Let's go! What did he say? What? By the sea...The hunter. Nothing much. Just to go hunting together. Why? Oh, it's nothing. What is it? Most wanted fugitives Granny? I have a secret. Good secret or bad? Bad secret. Actually, I'm not sure. If it's bad, then hide it. If it's good, just tell granny. You can tell a person is good or bad by their voice, right? Is Chef Eugene good or bad? What? Time flies so quickly. Any comments? It's cool. No, I mean, like your boss is a great person. Or not. All the bickering and fighting in the world... It's all useless. The day we first met... Did you really come to die? No. Then why were you standing there like that? I was curious if it was a suicide prohibited area or not. I thought someone was pulling a prank. Up here... Isn't it better than the sea? I loved the hills more than the sea. But long ago... A friend said... We'll go up the hill if we get sick of the sea. That's how I came to live there. But when I set to leave, the waves pull me back. Where is your friend, now? Don't know. Probably alive somewhere or dead. I don't want to know. Why do you live in a motel? 'Cause there are no neighbors there. What about you? I don't know anything about you. If their love lasted... maybe it would've been better. Better than it is now. A typical story. Guess quiet folks don't have some great stories, after all. You kept to yourself so much, I thought you had a big secret. Come sit, here. What's this? Open it. No, the box. Open it, again. What happened? It's magic! Happy birthday! Magic? Today's my birthday? It's been over a year since you got here. Blow out the candle. If you move your shoulder, I'll fire you. Just resting my head. It doesn't mean anything. I know one magic trick. Really? Wanna see it? Magic to make myself disappear. Can you see me? What do you think? Gone without a trace, right? Who did you learn that from? From Sang-byung. Where! In prison. Then you're... Yes. I'm on the run. My real name is LlM Su-in, not Eugene. I received Sang-byung's blood. Please tell me, if you know where she went. I don't know, either. I always wished all patients were like you. Always so positive and bright through all the hardships. But are you taking your medication these days? I take them regularly. Then why so down? Does your chef know? I didn't tell him. Any sexual relations? No. I know it's hard, but tell me what's bothering you. The fact...that I have AlDS. I thought it'd be best not to meet again. I guess he made it there. Why did you do that for me... Why. I was so curious. I was dying to know. But it's amazing. Really amazing. Seeing you here like this... I'm not curious anymore. Are you...okay? Su-in! Are you okay? Want some help? Two herbal teas, please. Maybe he saw us coming? Coffee, please. Ah...what do we report to the Chief? Nothing. Just say we saw the wrong guy. Run away. Run away. Where is he? He quit. Where does he live? I don't know. Look, Miss. Hiding him will make you an accomplice. Hello? It's me. Are you busy? We saw the wrong guy. Let's just leave it at that. Hello? It's me, Min-jung. Are you busy? I have some customers. Why? Mia? Just listen. I'm taking a vacation. Mia? I'm sorry. I just used you when you're sick. Even if you knew earlier, nothing would've changed. Take good care of yourself. Okay? Call me if you can. Granny says you're a good man. Go, hurry. Turn yourself in. Then what? It's better than dying. Let me ask you one thing. Did I kill the priest? Think it over. 11 MONTHS LATER Looking to hire a chef? I just need room and board. Think it's safe to show up here? It's better than not being here. I think... The cops came by a few times. Was my vacation too long? You're prettier without makeup, Mia. Everything's going great! Tell Eugene to make me something good! Promise? If you hear the cops, scream at the top of your lungs. (Wanna go to the market?) Watch carefully. Don't blink. I'll do it again. Watch carefully. Now, slice the back. Deeper. About half way. I'll do it again. Watch carefully. I told you not to blink. I can do a trick while you blink. Add some black pepper and lemon juice... Can you do it? I'll do it again. Don't blink, okay? Is that real or fake? Santa Barbara style roasted shrimp Call the chef over, please. Is it safe to eat what you make? Have a seat here, Mia. Mia! Why did you come back? Needed a place to hide? You're not in love with the lady, are you? You know you can't. Most wanted fugitives Did you know he's a fugitive? And he has AlDS. Mia... There's nothing between you two, is there? Thought we could get along, but you son of a bitch! I'll report you. Leave now. When are you leaving? Do I have to leave? It'd be better if you got caught. Then you can... Live. I guess. I watched for you on the news. I hoped you'd get caught. Or turned yourself in. Really. I could've turned myself in. Or keep running away. Then I'd never see you again. Will that solve anything? Is that what you want? But it'll cost you your life! The wind and the rain are a couple, you know... Open up! Open the door! Where is he? What's this? He won't last for long. He may die before his trial finishes. You can go to prison, too. Open it. He doesn't have much time left. Please look the other way. Please, I beg you. It's 'cause I feel sorry for you! And I know who the real killer is! Know why I didn't report you? I know something, too! I know who raped me! You hear me! Look me in the eyes! No! Don't! I know who it is! I could kill you! But I still prayed... We know everything, Miss. But he has to be punished. There's self inflicted, God given, and law judged punishments. Third one's the most important to people like us. And you are okay. I hated you to death... But I'm so relieved. Was it...like this? Wouldn't reporting me give me a chance to live? I should've written sooner. You once asked me... Living your whole life without seeing the sea... or cutting your life short and seeing it just once... which would I choose? I think I made the right decision. Mia is doing well. I am, too. At least for now. Mia! Mia! Mia! I'm fine. You look fine. Great food like this should be shared with others. I'm closing the place down. This is the last supper. So this is how you fire me. It's good. It's really good. It's so delicious. Wanna put on magic shows together? Hold your head up. Stopping a nose bleed won't save me. I'm not trying to save you. Just the nose bleed... Keep still like this. Su-in! Beautiful weather, huh? Yeah, it's great. Stand right there. There's one magic trick I didn't show you yet. Stand right there and close your eyes. Just for a minute. Didn't you tell me not to close my eyes? Too long? Then just 30 seconds. I can do magic like that, too.
