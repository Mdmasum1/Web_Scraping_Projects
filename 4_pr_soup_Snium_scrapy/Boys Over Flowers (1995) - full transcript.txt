foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Russian translation: Airen Redactor: Annyti Timing: Annyti English translation and timing adjustment: rusalka All right. I'm going. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hi! - Hi! Looks pretty. Pretty, right? I spent all vacation abroad. Hi. Hi. I'm Sanjo Sakurako. We will study together. Really? Nice to meet you. What's going on? Sale is already over... It's F4. What? You got to Eitoku and don't know F4? It can't be. They are heirs of rich families, 4 flowers - F4. F4? They are incredibly rich, all girls dream to date anyone of them. I'm not interested. - What? - It doesn't concern me at all. That's true. Me neither. Hey, you! You are from first year, right? You don't want to join F4 club? Entry - 50.000 yen. Expensive! What's that about? Sport-club? Of course, it's not sport they concentrate on! They just don't have where to spend free time. What did you say? Domyouji-san. - Look. It's the heir of Domyouji Corporation. - Who? I love tennis since pre-school, and golf - since first grade! I understand, but... It doesn't concern me. I've got no wish to join any club. But I invited you! Anyway, I don't have such money! Hey, who are you by the way? If you want to know my name, why don't you introduce yourself first? Eitoku Academy, 3 year. Leader of F4. Domyouji Tsukasa. Eitoku Academy, 1 year. Makino Tsukushi. Tsukushi? 'Tsukushi' - weed? Yes, "tsukushi" - it's a weed. No matter how much you will trample and rip it, you won't break it! As distinct from you, who grew up at a flower-bed! That's all... Arrange a sweet life to her! Which means, you got red note! Hana Yori Dango Boys Over Flowers Hey, Makino, you forgot something? - Don't come any closer. - Hey, wait! - Makino, where have you been? - Damn! Band of idiots. You are all insane! One day all what's hidden either way will be revealed! Huh, I'm better already. Now I can get back to work. He heard... Thank you. I would never thought that students can behave like that. - They are friends since childhood. - It's interesting, what F4 present themselves... The worst one is their leader, Domyouji. If they are called "4 flowers", means, they are pretty as flowers? Only from outside, inside - there is nothing bright. But it's no use saying it, you should see them. I would like to see them... You're lucky, there are only rich men around you. You don't understand anything!.. We studied together till highschool, why you're the only one who got there? Sounds like I had any choice! Parents put an application, I got a reply only from Eitoku. I attend to a third-rate university. And boys, who study there - they are all boring and from lower classes. I envy you so much. Maybe you want to swap with me? All I can do is swim with the current. By the way, there will be a huge party at summer. So what. I won't go. All earned money goes to school fees. Yes, but you have to find yourself a boyfriend. You don't want to spend all four years alone! Among those 4 there is no one who'll do? Well, there is one... What? What? Nothing. I have to eat something. What? In the night club stinks of sweat. Why they are all dancing, like idiots... There's nothing more interesting? - Yeah, isn't there anything more engaging? - There was - that weed, Makino Tsukushi. The one who got red note? - By the way, looking closer, she's not bad! - Where exactly? She somehow reminds your sister, Tsukasa. That's true! Nonsense! How could this weed remind my sister?! You show some attachment finally. Give me a break! All right, all right. After all, your sister got married last year and went to Beverly Hills. To be honest, there is no one like her. She's simply the best. It's posiible, but she had the other side either. She knew how to defend herself. - Yes, it's similar to that girl. - Exactly! - A propos, I saw her yelling. - Yelling? - 'One day all what's hidden either way will be revealed!' - And what does it mean? Either way, if I don't drive her out from school, it will ruin my personal life! You wanted to say 'my pride', dumbhead. And that girl... I will drive her off! Ah, one more day came to an end. It hurts!! And what's that? I have to go back home. - Hi. - Hi. - Thanks for the letter. - Thanks. - What are you talking about? - Don't deny. You put this into our locker yourself. You wrote, that you don't have anybody to talk to, as everyone is making fun of you according to F4 order. And, if we will listen to you, you'll do anything. What are you talking about? I know nothing about it. How you know nothing, you called us yourself! Let me go. Au, it hurts! Abandon all hope, richies! I won't let the one I don't like to touch even my finger. We'll see. Wait. Wait! Don't come any closer! Insane! Don't come any closer! Wait! Leave me alone! You don't have where to run! Hey, come to us! - Don't come any closer! - Wait! Get her! Wait! - Leave me alone! - Now it gets serious! - Wait!!! - Leave me alone! Tsukasa won't forgive us. Where did she go? - Ah, damn! - It's her. Catch her. Stop! Leave me alone! What are you doing?! Hanazawa-san! Domyouji-san ordered us. Leave her. But... - Domyouji-san ordered us! - Yes. That's enough, I said leave her! Let's go. Thank you. It's... Don't misunderstand. I just hate things like this. Hanazawa... ...Rui... - You failed? - Yes. - You're kidding, right? - We're sorry. I didn't ask you to rape her. But you ordered to bully her... Idiots! To bully - is to spread cream on her, - write something fishy on her... - What? But she is quite strong. Yes. And when we caught her, Hanazawa-san appeared. - Rui? - Yes. He told us to leave her. Damn, he is one of F4, what is he thinking? Anyway, you won't get from me 200.000 yen! Wait, Domyouji! Domyouji! Makino? - Domyouji-san, are you all right? - And you call yourself a man?! I'm not finished with you. We'll see, who wins. I'm prepared to answer a hit with a hit! That's how it is! Hey, Tsukasa, wake up! It's no use, he seems to be in shock. Hey! Onee-chan... Makino-san, one moment... Now the girls...? Hey, where are you taking me? Wait... Nobody will see us here . We're sorry, that we couldn't help you earlier. There is no need, I don't really care. You're so strong, I respect you so much for this! Not so strong at all... If something like that would happen to me, I would definitely ran out of school... I would like to get known you better. Me too. You're just superb! Joanne D'Arc of our school. Thank you... There's a party at my home tonight. You have to come! Party? I would like to, but I don't have a dress... It's an ordinary party, a denim one, ordinary clothes will be all right. Please, come. You'll forget about everything. Here is a map how to get to Sakurako house, we start at 7. Don't stop. You play violin, how wonderful... - What's this melody? Really beautiful... - Don't pretend you're interested. At this university no one is interested in music. This... I would like to thank you for yesterday properly. Thank you. It would be better if I didn't rescue you. What? If I had known, that you will be following me afterwards, I would leave you there. But... I was happy... It was the first time since entering Eitoku, that I was happy... Maybe we will meet somewhen at the firestairs. Then I won't go there anymore. - What a huge house! - Makino-san! Here, here. Hurry up. What is she wearing? Sakurako, you said it's a denim party... It was a joke, obviously, and you believed it? It's so tactless, appearing at an elegant party looking like this! Even if you were said, that it's a denim party, how could you really come wearing jeans? I'm going home. Well, Makino-san, it's not a place for you anyway. But you were invited, so you can as well stay for a while. Look... The famous Zuniya brothers came. And there is the son of the president of Busan Company. He often travels to New York, even you, Makino-san, should know him. Funny, right? Someone without a social status can take part in such a reception. Here, please. And this too, please. Yes, in that outfit you look more like a waitress. Such a dishonour, I would die if I were you! Oh, come on, don't laugh at her. Makino-san, please try foie gras. It was made by a renowned chef. It's obvious you don't eat like that each day, try not to damage your stomach. Exactly. Oh, what a wastefulness, poor champagne! Good, now that outfit would even smell nice. What are you up to? Makino-san, you have to change your clothes. - We'll take you. - Come. What do you want? Let me go! - You're an eyesore. - That's right! You pretend to be nice and innocent, only to catch the attention from F4! I don't care if you're Yomogi or Tsukushi, weed is a weed. A poor ones like you will never match any of great F4. You're totally different than us, understand? I don't want to even stand close to you. The exit is there! Hey, you! Domyouji! Domyouji-san! We were waiting for you. Who let you invite her here? - What are you talking about? - To laugh at her... only I have that right! Tomorrow you will all receive red notes. Nooo! You're all right? - What are you doing? - What do you mean: what? Whose fault it is, in your opinion, that I end up like this? Idiot! Idiot? How do you speak to me, I just saved you! And I didn't ask you to! - Nobody have ever treated me like that! - Because everyone is afraid of you! And why am I such a bad guy? Try to explain it! Your stupidity is annoying. Your hair is annoing. You're attempts to look cool are annoying. And your serpentine eyes are annoying. You... You're all annoying! And why did he suddenly become such a good boy? An octopus he was, and so he'll be forever! Good morning, loser! And why do I have to do this alone? - Oh, our girl is making her best. - No, it's a toiler girl. - Rui told us about everything! - Our shy-guy saved you. Don't talk like this about him. - Whatever, it's just in his character. - Exactly. - And where is Hanazawa Rui? - He is not interested in sports. He's afraid he gets sweat. - Reach people's whims... - His health is weak since childhood, even Shizuka was looking after him. - By the way, she's coming back soon? - The day after tomorrow, I think. - Who is Shizuka? - Todo Shizuka. - Our childhood friend. - Rui's first love. He thinks about her even now. - She's coming back from Boston. - Really, she became such a beauty... - Well, see you, toiler girl. Don't call me that! Todo Shizuka... Let go of me! We kind of did explain it to you. Looks like it's hard for you to understand. So clever, with your face... Are you really that bored? If you have so much spare time, dedicate yourselfs to F4. And that's the point. You look like you didn't get it. What's that all harrassment about? Maybe I am a weed, but that's why I won't give up so easily! Sakurako-san. Oh my god... My nose... Don't worry, you'll make one more operation and you''ll be just fine. Yes, and it will get back to it's place at once. It's not possible. I'll kill you! You're dead! Thank you very much. Damn silicon. Just let me get you. - One day all what's hidden... - ...all what's hidden either way will be revealed! You said you won't come here anymore. I can't? Not that you can't, just... I like it here. University noise doesn't reach here. - You know what, Shizuka... - What? No, Nothing. I just thought how quiet is in here. (Shizuka - girl's name, but also 'quiet') It suits you. This? - Really? But thanks god it's not worse. - Yes, it's all right. What we are going to do? Maybe some tea? - No, I'm going home. I don't have any money. - Well I can buy you a coffee. Thanks! - No, it's nothing strange. - Exactly. Ah, she's so beautiful. And now there is a skin tonic too. - Todo Shizuka. - What? - Hey, look. - I'm looking already. No, look at that guy. He's kissing a poster... maniac. - Come on, let's go. - I'm coming. Hey, she came. - Tsukasa, how are you? - You're beautiful as always. - Just like white heron. - White swan, stupid. - Welcome home. - Rui. - Aaa. - You saw it, right? Hey, what's with you? Guys, stop! - Thank you. - It's F4's fault? They're not bad, just sometimes crosses the lines. - If you say so... - Just forgive them. Look, it's still a litlle dirty. Girl should always look well. Because she never knows, when the fortune turns on her. Wonderful shoes! There is a saying abroad: If you're wearing wonderful shoes, they will take you to wonderful places. That's why you should always chose shoes, which make you fly. Now it's all all right. Thank you very much. Wait a moment, please... My name is Makino Tsukushi. Tsukushi, like weed. Todo Shizuka. Nice to meet you. We've been meeting here before quite often. I miss that time. - Yes, it's 2 years now. - How time flies... Really, friends like us are called friends like bamboo. You wanted to say 'true blue friends'. Dumbhead. And you as always, Tsukasa. Please excuse me. Come on, don't be mad. How is your sister? She got married last year and now she lives in Beverly Hills. You must miss her. You were so close. Well, there is a good replacement for her now. Makino Tsukushi. - Is that right? - And you about that mendicant girl again. Is she really resembling his sister? Yes, yes, resembling. Don't joke like that. Or I'll lose my temper. - But we're serious. - Rui, you didn't tell even one word. - Shizuka came back. - I know, don't pay attention to me. - It's always like that, when everyone is having a good time, he is sad. - That's true... - It's not funny! - Rui... - And what did you have pictures taken for? - There's nothing wrong in advertising a skin tonic. I don't like it. Shizuka, you're not stupid. I'm sorry, I... Thank you, Rui. You're so thoughtful. That's what I like in you. Hey, maybe we're disturbing you? Let's drink! Cheers! Cheers! By the way, Tsukasa, I'm having a party tomorrow. Invite that girl too. - That girl? - Tsukushi-chan. - Why me? - Behave yourself, understand? Understand? You're insane. You're teasing me. Why should I bring her? That idiot, Domyouji! Let me go! Stop it! Help! Stop it! Why did you bring me here? Stop it! Hot, hot, hot. Cold. Stop it! Stop it! Stop... On the right, right there. Aa, how nice. Yes, yes. So, how was it? In a beauty parlour? - Nothing interesting. - It doesn't cost me anything, of course, but all that is worth about 150.000 yen. 150 000 yen?! Hey, what are you up to? If Shizuka hadn't asked me, no one would bother about you. Shizuka-san? Welcome. - Welcome. Don't humble yourself. Welcome. Domyouji-sama. We're grateful, that you bought a dress for your sister at our place. Dress her. - Wait, I don't intend... - Something suitable for a party. - Party? - Certainly, what design you prefer? Well... Something red, and with a lot of trinkets. Girls look well in red. Then, miss, please come with us. Miss? Me? Domyouji, where are they taking me? Wonderful. - Wait a moment, what party is it? - Stand straight! Relax! Take a deep breath! OK. Hey! - Hi, Tsukasa. - Hi. - Not bad! - Quite nice! She literally put on herself some grandmother's rag. You have just used a wrong kanji, idiot! Shut up. You'd better go to the table and eat. It's an occasion for a poor one. And how can a rich one know it? - Don't shout. - What? That means, the gossip was true. - Shut up, stupid. - I'm getting hungry. I'll go to the table. - Be careful, so that stomach wouldn't hurt from glutting. - You don't have to worry about it. Excuse me. Leave it. - Please give us a helping of that. - Certainly. Thank you. - Please. - Thank you. - It's foie gras. Try it. - Delicious! - Really? - You're not going to...? - I... I don't eat animal-derived products. - It's really delicious! - I'm glad you like it. I'll get you something else too. - You don't have to. I'll do it myself. - Really? All right then. Thank you. Good evening. Thank you all for your time and gathering at the Todos' party. At first please let speak our host, Todo Shizuka. She has a little announcement to make. Friends, thank you all, that you gathered here for me. Shizuka looks particularly beautiful today. Studying in Boston, I made some decision. And I would like to share it with you. During those two years, that I've lived abroad, I understood how I was living before. I've never denied myself anything. But I don't want to live like that anymore. That is why I, Todo Shizuka, am going to New York next week. And don't intend to come back to Japan anymore. Is it true? What is Shizuka thinking? Hmm, I... I'm going out. Please tell others. All right. One more glass, please. Excuse me, excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Such a big house, a map would be of use. Where is a toilet? Yes, sometimes. - Hey, Domyouji. - What? Hey, behave yourself as befits a girl. Well, I'm not your girl. Oh, it's hard to be rich. You have to pretend that you're smart. I don't pretend, I am smart! My father doesn't have any partners, and I'm his only hope! But anyway... Such a poor girl as yourself won't understand it. Hmmm, that's the only thing that draw girls to you, right? - What did you say? - You were just surrounded by models and partners and you were all shaking. And now you're not, you're so double-faced! Stupid! That girls are with me only because of my status. It's written on their faces, that it's all for money. It's obvious, that I don't need a girl like that. Don't be stupid! I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. What?! It's you who should be asking for forgiveness! Ask for forgiveness for all that bullying. You're the one to blame. - And what did I do? - You should think a little about consequences. You're not the one to judge it! Makino. Domyouji-san, Domyouji-san. I don't feel well. - Good morning. - Makino-san, good morning. - Makino-san, good morning. - Good morning. - Hey, Makino, how are you? - What's going on? Makino-san, hi! Makino-san! Makino-san, Makino-san... It can't be... It's me? It's a mistake! It's a mistake! - Hi, Tsukasa. - What's going on there? And here he comes. So, what were you doing? Date with a girl? Well, invite her! Domyouji-sama! Tsuki, and you hadn't said a word! For how long? Hey, it's all your fault. And who drank at the party? It's... I'm sorry. Tsukasa, don't be so ashamed, that's love. Tell them how it is, so that there won't be any misunderstandings. How are you? You're free tonight? I'll wait for you today at six. Wait! Why...? Long time no see. How are you? - Tsukasa, long time no see. - How are you? Stand straight! Relax! Take a deep breath! I know. - Hey, what are you doing here? - Long time no see. - Tsukasa, long time no see. That's my girlfriend. - Hey! - It can't be! - Hey, is that true? I mean, is that true, that you've got yourself a girlfriend? So that's how your taste looks like. Yes, that's it. Sit down. I'm going to a ladies room. So it's true? You're clever. How much does he pay you? For such a face. What did you just say? Repeat it. Nothing interesting. Don't mess with me. It hurts, it hurts. I'm going. - Wait! - No way! You're the worst! Hey, Makino, wait! Wait. I'm sorry. It's nothing, just your world is different from mine. Don't talk like that. It's not like you. I feel a little strange. Why? All mistakenly think, that we're dating. They all at once became so nice, like that bullying never happened. To tell you the truth, I'm grateful to you, That you didn't tell the truth in front of them all. But it's also a pity. If they get known, that it's a lie, it would all began from a start. It's not a lie! I said, that you're my girlfriend. That's... Well, I don't really care. And you as always. It's me, who shouldn't care, not you. You're going to a summer party? - I don't know. - We'll go together. - Well... - Don't get it wrong. To such a weed as yourself, no one would pay any attention. I just feel sorry for you. I'm just a volunteer. Well I'm so sorry! Decide, will you go with me or not. Or you want them to tease you again? You're using my misery! I'll go. I just can't say no. Yeah, it's definitely better to go. Bye. Makino. I invited personally you. Don't take it too lightly. Good night! Good morning. Welcome. Shizuka-san! Thank you, that you came to my party. I want to take with me some Japanese sweets. You're flight... is tomorrow, right? Yes, will you help me chose? I'll start all from the very beginning in New York. I want to cut off from Todo family. I always dreamed of getting everything on my own. But it's not possible in Japan. Shizuka-san, don't go, please. Don't go to America. Why, all of a sudden? I beg you. I know, I don't have a right to tell you this. But I beg you, stay in Japan. For Hanazawa Rui's sake... stay in Japan. Makino-san, it's impossible. Impossible. It's impossible to agree with your decision. It's the first time I see him so sad. Shizuka-san, please! Makino-san, hear me out. You really think that Rui will be happy, if for his sake I resign from myself and leave evething half way, staying in Japan? It's necessary to learn to understand your feelings. People live with thought: 'Ah, I should have done like that'. And I don't want to live like that. That's why I'm going. Shizuka-san, please forgive me. Nothing happened. It was a great pleasure. I admire your courage. No wonder, that you could stand out against Tsukasa. That's... I really like you. I really like you too. I admire you. Thank you. And Hanazawa Rui didn't come. Yeah, stupid. Making a victim of himself. Cheer up, such a long face doesn't suit you. - Domyouji. - What? Is it love? What's with you? To hide true feelings, even if it ends up like that. Is it all right? No, it's not. It's just like there was nothing from the very beginning. Why do you ask such obvious questions? And if you die tomorrow? You know how sorry you'll be? What? Nothing, you just got so serious all of sudden. You what, think I'm stupid? - And you just noticed that? - Shut up, octopus. So he's not here. How are you? I'm used to it. Really. Why are you standing? Sit down. OK. Shizuka-san is all right either. I don't like farewells. She really won't come back anymore? When she decide it herself... She doesn't care, what will anyone say. She doesn't like to lose, since childhood. Although everyone say, that what's best for her - is to stay in Japan, I think, this choice suits her very well. You love Shizuka-san exactly for that, right? Althought you look so sad... Damn... I... I... I like when you're smiling. Althought sadness on your face - is like a painting, Hanazawa Rui's smile - is my treasure. So recover soon. And start to smile again. I'll try. Promise! I promise. Makino?! You didn't know? In fact Makino-san likes Hanazawa-san. They always meet at the firestairs. For quite a long time. At the firestairs? And, in spite of that, she was dating with you. Poor Domyouji-san. Domyouji-san... I... for a long time... - Leave me. - What? You what, deaf? I said leave me. Shall I get you something? There's no need, I'll get something myself later... - Is champaign all right? - Yes. You lose weight. You think so? - And color of your face is somehow strange... - It's because of this light. You had a dinner? Yes. What did you ate? A cherry. I'll bring you something to eat. And I thought that F4 bullying somehow ended. Excuse me, excuse me! - You hit my back with your arm! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Please, forgive me! Stop it! Are you out of your mind? Leave me! If someone like him dies, would it change anything? It would change. It would change! Death is the worst what can happen! Anyone of you wants? What's wrong with you? It's not like you. You're worrying about me? Or just don't want me to smear this saint place? You're, obviously, happy, that Shizuka left. I can start bullying all over again. What are you talking about? - You fooled me well. - What are you talking about? Don't pretend, traitor. I said, that you're my girlfriend. But I... I'll teach you a lesson! What are you doing? Let me go! I'll scream. Try. Who would dare to oppose me to save you? You think, Rui will save you? What do you want to say by that? It's with you... It's all your fault! Don't get any closer! Let me go, let me go! Idiot. Don't cry. I won't do it again. I believe you. But you don't believe me, right? Don't make such a face. So that's where rich people spend time. Sleepyhead! You always use your head not what it was meant for! When I see your face, I forget how beautiful it is here! And how hot it is. You're right. I'm sorry, it's just how it is. All of them care only about getting a tan. I can't watch it. I don't like to sunbake. Just ignore it. Let's go. - We need one more player. - No. - I said, let's go. - I don't want to. Wait, stop it. Well done, Tsukushi! Let's go! Hey, let's go! - What are you doing? - Nothing. And you? I can't sleep. You were here all the time? Yes. Something wrong? Maybe you got cold, 'cause you were here all this time. What? Cold. - Could you give me a hug? - What? During the day I can even stand it, but at nights I'm so cold. You should ask those girls, who surround you. No, I don't need strangers. Why are you crying? Don't worry about me. I'm all right now. You can leave me now. - Think about Tsukasa. - I can't! I want to leave you, but you're the only thing I can think of. But why, why? Why can't you be happy? I can't throw you out of my head. So it's like that! Tsukasa. So this is what's going on. Stop it, Domyouji. Stop it! Stop it, Domyouji, please. Stop it. Wait, Domyouji. Listen me out, please. You still have something to say?! I trusted you, I was going to open my soul... That's... And you have all those feelings... trampled down. - Wait, I... - Don't touch me! We're over. Don't talk to me again. Domyouji... Everything will be all right. I'm here. So round... Magnificent. Rui! You're no longer a childhood friend, you're nobody, you're just a traitor. I banish you from F4. You're under boycott. - I'm so sorry, it's all my fault. - You have nothing to apologise for. - If I wouldn't go to that beach... - It's me who wanted to kiss you. You're not the one to blame. But... Next Sunday... Let's go somewhere together. All right. There is more people than fishes in here. But some of them don't draw so much attention. Look. Octopus! This one looks exactly like Domyouji. Pretending to be smart. Exactly like octopus! Look, look, how beautiful. She looks like Shizuka-san. - Look, even swims... - Listen... Let's not talk about Shizuka. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I... It's all right, you don't have to excuse yourself like that. Good girl. Bring it to me. Juni! Good girl, good girl. Listen, how long are you going to quarrel with Rui? You're friends since childhood. - Maybe... - That's why I can't just forgive him. He isn't serious about Makino! - You think? - Of course! He loves and always loved only Shizuka. He's just using Makino to forget about her. Tired? Not at all. And you're not hungry? See, because you don't eat meat, I took a fish-burger. I have enough fishes for today. Yes, that's true. Have you already decided, which dress wear to the party? What's here to decide, I don't have any. Well... there is one, but... I'll give you one. What? May I? Yes, you need something unconventional. And color... just like that. Imperial court. What? It's like I'm at the imperial court. But something is not right. Instead of enjoing it, I'm trying to go somewhere else all the time. - Tsukushi. - What? This 'somewhere else' - is not just where Domyouji is? I understand, that you've been dating each other for a long time. And you understand it yourself, don't you? Makino? What do you want? I... asked some other girl to the party. Really? I'm sorry, I couldn't keep my promise. It's nothing. That's all that I wanted to tell you, you can do what you want now. What do you mean? Which one of us always do what he wants? You said I can do what I want, but I don't know what I want. That's why I hate such egoists as yourself! Domyouji... You still can catch him, Tsukushi. I don't have the right to catch him. To catch your beloved one - you don't need any rights. I... lost... his love, his smile... It's necessary to learn to understand your feelings. People live with thought: 'Ah, I should have done like that'. And I don't want to live like that. That's why I'm going. I... I can't go with you to the party. It's not me who should be with you. Tsukushi... Don't lie to yourself anymore. Domyouji said: 'To hide true feelings - is just like there was nothing from the very beginning.' If she's really so precious to you, go after her, no matter where. Makino Tsukushi. You're alone? Yes. That's what I like in you. Strength that I lack. Don't talk like that. Thank you. I understood I can't be like that anymore. I have to thank you either. Thanks to you I understood, what's important to me. Pity, that I understood it so late. Well, I... Stand straight! Relax! Take a deep breath! I think that's what he says. Domyouji. Translation: Airen Redactor: Annyti Timing:: Annyti English translation and timing adjustment: rusalka
