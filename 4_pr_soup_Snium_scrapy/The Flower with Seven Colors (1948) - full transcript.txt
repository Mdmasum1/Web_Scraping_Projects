Ah, no, this is too long for little kids. Oh, how many crows all around! They are decidedly at least a million of the here. Let me count them. One crow on the balcony. And there's another one except he's taller Raven's second on the roof of the barn - two! And another one also on the roof, except he's a bit higher - three! Ah, Mummy! Granny! Don't cry, little girl! Don't cry, I know everything! I even know why the dog ate your bagels, little girl. Why? - Because you were walking and not paying attention, - yes looking around, reading displays, - yes - counting crows - Yes. How did you know? Are you smart? No, I'm cunning! It's al right, Jenya, do not cry! I'll help you. Come with me, Jenechka. Of course, I don't have any bagels and no money either. But that's not what happiness is about. Where is my bell? Come here cloud! Cloud, stop! Water my garden. This is not a common flower. It is magical! It can make any of your wishes come true! - But how? - It's simple! Just tear one of it's petals: yellow, green, blue, orange, purple red or pink - throw it up and say, "Fly, Fly, petal, from the west to the east, Soar around the whole Earth, and let my wish come true " And your wish will come true. Do you understand? I understand, I understand! Then repeat! - Fly, Fly, petal, Fly ... Fly ... to the Far East ... I forgot! Oh you airhead! Try to remember! Oh, I remember! Fly, Fly, petal, from the west to the east, Soar around the whole Earth, and make my wish come true! make me be home with the bagels! - Mum! - You're back? Yes, Mum, I have returned. How did you come in without me noticing? I don't know... Did you get the bagels? Yes, Mummy, I did. Good job, honey, thank you! this flower is truly not a common flower! I should put it in the most beautiful vase. In the most beautiful! Oh, how many crows! Did you break something again. You're so clumsy Was it my favourite vase? No, no, Mummy! [Quietly] Fly, Fly, petal, from the west to the east, Soar around the whole Earth, and make my wish come true! Make it so that the vase becomes whole again! Wow, so it's really magical! It is simply unbelievable! It means that anywhere, any time I will get what I want instantly! I just have to start wanting something that is the most worthwhile! - I'll will wish me... -[shouting] - Hooray! We can see the North Pole! Go away, little girl! Go away! Don't get in the way. Go away, don't get in the way! Come on boys, let me play. Yeah, right! Can't you see it's the North Pole! We don't take girls to the North Pole - So you won't take me? - Hooray! Fine,I don't need it! I'll get to the North Pole without you. Except not the one you're going to, but the real one!! Fly, Fly, petal, from the west to the east, Soar around the whole Earth, and make my wish come true! I wish to be at at the North Pole right away! Mister, do you bite?! Mister, don't you bite? - Mister,this is the North Pole, right? - Uh-huh. The North Pole! North Pole! The North Pole! - Mister, that is the Northern Light, right? - Yeah. And are those seals? Wow how many of them there are! Let me count them! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven ... I am going to eat you, little girl! Oh, Mummy! Aaa ... Fly, Fly, petal, from the west to the east, Soar around the whole Earth, and make my wish come true! Let this mean bear find himself in a zoo cage right away! So now I've been to the North Pole! I need to come up with something more interesting to wish for. Let me wish for... No, not that... No. No, not that... If I eat something yummy, then there won't be anything left! Maybe I should wish for a toy! Except...which one? Wow, what a doll! Girl, what is the name of your doll? I named her Matilda! I'm going with Matilda to a toyshop. Let me help you. You'll be Matilda 's mum and I'll be Matilda 's nurse. You'll walk next to us And I'll walk her in a stroller. Okay? I don't want to! Just for a little bit! No, don't touch my Matilda! Your hands are dirty. You probably have a runny nose. You'll make her sick. And in general, one should have one's own toys! You won't let me? No, you should have your own toys. Well, then don't! I'll show you now who has toys! Then we'll see! Fly, Fly, petal, from the west to the east, Soar around the whole Earth, and make my wish come true! Let all the toys of the world...be mine! Oh, no, I don't want this! I'm scared! Oh, oh! Enough! Oi! Enough! I don't need this many toys at all! I was just kidding! I'm scared Parrot: I do not need more toys! I was joking! I am afraid, afraid, afraid! Fly, Fly, petal, from the west to the east, Soar around the whole Earth, and make my wish come true! Make all the toys go back to the stores! I only have one petal left. I wasted so many petals, and got no enjoyment! But it's OK! At least I still have one more left! I'll wish for something very useful! First of all, 400 grams of candy, Of course, flat ones, and round ones, A toy primus, stove and cabinet. Fifteen cheesecakes and muffins, A full plate of Chinese nuts, And a big fish with caviare, Then a jack in the box. And a pink cape for kids. Then some sandals and a white hat. A green rabbit soap. A toy stove,which I already mentioned. A soft sitting cube, a hedgehog, Four cakes, a pound roasting, And a vase full-full of blossoms And all of this right away! Then a jack in the box and a pink cape ... What are you talking about, girl? Me? - nothing. - Boy, what's your name? - Victor. - What's yours like? - Jenya. Victor, you know what? Let's play! - Play what? - Tag! Vic, where are you going? Wait, Victor, wait! I didn't know! Did you really not know? I give you my word, I didn't know. I just you really liked you and I wanted to run around with you. And I really liked you too. I'd be glad to run around too. - But I can't. That's so unpleasant. Unfortunately, it's for life. For life? You're talking about such trifles, Victor! Here, look! Fly, Fly, petal, from the west to the east, Soar around the whole Earth, and let my wish come true. I wish for Victor to become healthy! Vic, where did we end up? I don't know. I think we got lost. I think so too. How are we going to get back home? That's not a problem! I'll get it all fixed. Where is my flower? Victor, I'm tearing off a petal! Oh no! - What happened? I don't have any petals left. Only the stalk is left. We're doomed! You are once again crying near my garden? Granny! I know, I know. You don't have to explain. I wasted my last petal on him. Look, only the stalk is left! I know everything. This stalk had seven magical petals. Six of them you wasted completely. They flew away and will never return. But one petal, the pink one, You spent for a good reason! You helped the boy Victor! This petal flew around a bit, made a circle and came back to me. Here it is! Look how beautiful and fresh it is! Maybe I can grow a new flower out of it for you. A new 7 petal flower. Let's go. Where is my shovel? Where is my bell? Victor, dig a hole here. And now, Jenya, plant your stalk here. Pour, cloud, don't hold back your water! All done? Not yet, no. Al right cloud, pour even more water. It's growing!
