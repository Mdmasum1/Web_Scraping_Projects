But... this is the condition of the can. Or you could just look in another store to get the better ones. But yes, you can take this one. In another shop, the price has gone up, Mr. Mahmud. That's why I picked it up at your shop. It's okay. I'll just take this one. The price is tight. But if you are pleased with the condition of the can, it's okay. Mr. Mahmud, I am satisfied. I'll take that one. Okay. - Excuse me, sir. - Please. MAHMUD'S GROCERY STORE Sir, I'd like to buy this one for 50 kg. There's only 70 kg left in the warehouse for that one, ma'am. Just take 20 kg, okay? Wait, what do you mean? If necessary, I will increase the price to 10,000. Take all of your stock in the warehouse. I will empty it out. Goodness. Ma'am, what if someone else needs it? What kind of person are you, sir? Are you a businessman? I will make you a profit. Why don't you even want it? It's not business. It's devotion. MAHMUD'S GROCERY STORE God is almighty. God is almighty. God is almighty. What's wrong with you, Dad? How many times have I told you? Don't take down this photo of Heli anymore. - Dad? - It's no use to put that up. He never comes home. Whether he comes or not, he is still my brother. Your son. I'll be leaving first. Wait... Where are those three men? They have already gone, sir. They wanted to buy clothes for Eid. Half-hearted devotion. Fasting is about holding back hunger, thirst, lust, get it? - Yes, sir. - And one more, resist the temptation. Half-hearted devotion is characteristic of hypocritical humans. Well, the essence of my preaching tonight is about hypocrisy. Sir, sorry in advance. I want to say goodbye first. Wait, just a moment. You haven't prayed witr yet. Later, sir, at home after tahajjud. I want to go to the market. Shopping. Please understand, it's my father-in-law. Come on, Sro. Are you afraid of God or your in-laws? Of course, God, sir. But then, God has destined me to have a stern in-law, sir. Moreover, we're still sharing the same house. God is all-knowing, sir, why I should obey my in-laws. Sro, when you go to hereafter, you will... - Please excuse me. - Me too. - I'm sorry, sir. - Yes. - I'm in a hurry. - Until next time, sir. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. It will only trouble us, isn't it? That's right. It's no use. It's only a show-off. Peace be upon you. Someone acts all holy. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. I represent the community and residents to tell this to you. We have some complaints. Yes, while it's being discussed, Mr. Gatot, I need to remind all of you, please. We have to repent before being tortured in the hereafter, okay? Frankly speaking, the price you have set is too high. It has to be lowered. The thing is fulfilling devotion through trading should be... Will they be responsible if we go bankrupt, sir? They must be looking for another shop, right? Trade is trade. It is only profitable when selling. If you don't sell, then don't make a loss. - You're right. - Am I right? Ma'am, trading is not always about profit. It's all about sincerity. - That's true. - Right. - What are we talking about? - You want more crowd for your store. - That's right. - Basic. Wait... Do you actually have a religion or not? Hey! It's my business, sir! Your business with me is about the price! If you continue to use this price, we might not be able to make a profit! What about my children's school expenses? - Calm down. - What about them? - What's wrong with him? - Calm down. - Is he dumb or something? - He acts like... Actually, it's all based on religion. There are even rules when we take a leak. What's more in trading? Well, the difference between people who understand religion... Well, it should be more... More what? More correct? Do you mean we are all wrong? What about the money corruption of Quran? Did that person understand about religion? Please distinguish people who understand and those who are knowledgeable, ma'am. Blah! Knowledgeable, my ass! About what? Stealing money? That people need nine billion rupiahs only to determine Isbat Session. - What? - Nine billion? - And who's money is that? - It's impossible, ma'am. Of course it's possible! Do you really not know or just pretend? Don't you have television at home? Or do you need a newspaper? It's enough. Please listen. I'll explain, ma'am. No need! You ruined the price so everyone went to your shop, didn't you? We all need money. The difference is we are not good at selling religion like you! That's right, miss. Let's go home, miss. He's being difficult. We better meet the Kyai. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Listen, Mud. The ministry has to invite and gather all representatives of Islamic sects in Indonesia. Sit together, talking, consulting, and deliberating. This costs a lot for accommodation. The number is hundreds, Mud. Please, Mud. This is your favorite. Yes, thank you. This is it, Ful. I always long for your hot ginger drink. This makes me remember Kyai Tohid. Every time suhoor is over, we will together drink ginger with palm sugar like this. Right? After that, pray Fajr together, then parade to the south looking for hilal. I still remember Kyai's words. That the hilal is the gate of Eid. This parade is a migration of the heart in seeking to find fitrah. Fitrah grows on the way. Holding back hunger and thirst. Holding back all the pain. And we still always dhikr. There's no god, but God. It's from the heart here. - "From the heart emerges morality. - "From the heart emerges morality. - From morals become benefits. - From morals become benefits. - From benefits become grace." - From benefits become grace." You're right. You still memorize it. Yes, strongly, Ful. Yes... Ful... We have to do it again. We must... go to Kyai's place again. Yes, we can do it. We must... see hilal. Okay. - You must join, Ful. - Of course! I'm serious, Ful. Me too. My goodness. The Ministry of Religion confirmed that the budget of nine billion for the Isbat Session is not true. The budget spent is not up to two billion rupiah. Blackout, necessities rise, Isbat not clear. Goodness. Life is hard and endless. The easy thing doesn't make money. Those people won't have a job if it's easy. Just watch your mouth, Sro. You don't want to jinx yourself. The people you're talking about are all hajji. They've made things difficult for us. Why can't we complain? Shush! Watch your words! Okay. - Excuse me, Mr. Mahmud. - Excuse me, Mr. Mahmud. Yes, please. Sro. Close. It's still this hour, sir. Close. Dad, are you eating spicy food again? Your appendix may relapse. Where are you going? I have a business. Okay, but where? What's wrong with you? Who are you going with? Alone. Gosh, Dad. Check with the doctor first, okay? What? I'm not sick, yet you send me to the doctor. Dad... You have to go to the doctor. It could be gout symptoms. My child, it's going to be Eid soon, and tomorrow, I have to go. Dear me, Dad. What if there is something on the way? It's not that easy, Hel. We can try it, Halida. It's your own fault. Why don't you come home from yesterday? Right, this isn't your house anymore, is it? I'm not your sister. Dad is not your dad. We are just people who keep your family card. Isn't that right, Hel? Don't make things difficult, Halida. Don't waste time being angry at me while in another part of the world, there are people who need me, waiting for me. Where? Nicaragua? Are you really that important of an activist? Even your own family is not that important. Why are you still complicating things up? I came to this house just to take my family card and birth certificate so I can make a passport, that's it. Hey! It's near Eid. It can't be done in two or three days. Do you think those people don't need a day off? Right, Eid. Then you have to help me. My situation is very critical. I only have two weeks to go to Nicaragua. If I know internal employees, the process can be faster... Hey! You called yourself an activist, but you want me to collude? What an activist. It's different. I won't ask for your help if you don't... Listen, Halida, please try... This is the month of fasting. Learn a little manners. Dad? Dad? Dad... One wants to find hilal and the other wants to go to Nicaragua. My God, please give me patience. You can do everything that you want, but at least go to the doctor first, Dad. Are you done? I'm done. Well then... I'm leaving, okay? Dad... Dear me, Dad! Dad... Why are you being like this? Dad, please go to the doctor, okay? I'll take you there later. My child, if I die later... and haven't had time to see the hilal, I will regret it. Dad, if anything happens to you, I can't forgive myself, Dad. I beg you, Dad. Come on. Dad. Do you really want me living all my life in guilt? My child, your dad is old. There's no more chance... Dad, my only parent is you now. Please understand, Dad. Okay then, if you insist. You can go - as long as... - What? Bring your cellphone, Dad. - I brought it. - Active? Medicine? Medicine? I didn't forget it. Here it is. - One more thing, Dad. - What? Heli must accompany you. Hey. Are you serious, Halida? I came here to take care of my passport, not my dad. Are all activists like you, Hel? You stand up for other countries, but your own dad? You don't even want to accompany him. Did he ever accompany Mom while she was sick? Do you think our late mother will be happy when she sees you disrespect Dad like that? Enough! Dad. If he wants to come, tell him to hurry up. - I don't want to... - Enough! Do you want your passport or not? Well? Hurry! Frankly, I think Faruk is more competent to be the team leader now. Heli is in a lot of trouble. He can't even handle easy matters like this! I know, but Faruk is still in Papua. And I believe Heli is competent to lead us. Just stop it! We don't have time to protest. Next time... Heli is calling. Yes, hello, Hel? Yes, I have the schedule for you. Tomorrow,you will lead the briefing in Bandung... Shinta, I understand. When I get my passport, I'll go straight away, okay? Hel, I've made the schedule for... Hello, Hel? Heli? ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR BELONGINGS So you still don't want to tell me where we are going? If I explain it, you will ask more. Is it my fault for asking a question? Sometimes, a person has to act like Prophet Khidr. What about that prophet, Dad? Special for you, your dad right now is like the Prophet Khidr who talks to the illiterate. Yes, please make a riot while wearing a robe like that! They have good intentions to remind everyone not to take the wrong path. Just like you. Like me? Come on, sir. Come on, sir. - Young man. - Yes, sir. It's noon. Yes, sir. One mosque has passed. We have passed one mosque. Why don't we pray first, young man? We are travelers, aren't we, sir? Travelers? Wait... Aren't you fasting, young man? Gosh, sir, my job is heavy and risky. What if I'm tired or sleepy? How about my passengers' safety? Have you paid fidyah? Not yet, sir. Young man, people who delay prayer, later in the hereafter will meet the snake king. That snake often hits sinners over and over again. That's just delaying prayer. Not to mention people who don't fast. Also people who don't pay fidyah. Especially... adultery. What a sin! Perhaps have you ever committed adultery? What a crazy old man. People who know but pretend not to know will be cursed by God to the greatest extent. You are a driver now. But in the hereafter, you are a member of hell. Hey! Who are you, old man? What is God? Just let me be. If I go to hell, just let it be. Are you the God? The Lord? Wait, don't be misguided when someone gives you guidance. As the driver, the responsibility is big. You're carrying so many passengers. So when you suddenly die, what is your afterlife provision? What is it? Tell me about it. Sir, just get off! Get out of here! Ya, get them off. Get them off. Get off? Get off. Just get off, sir. Get off. Annoying. Are we there yet, Dad? Gosh, I thought it was far away. Here. Where is the change? Count it again, sir. That's everything. I think there is a problem. I feel wronged. What do you mean, sir? The bus is only halfway there. Okay then, it's your right. I don't want to talk about money in the afterlife. What's wrong with you? That's it, enough. Okay, thank you. Okay, carry on. So they kicked us out? What? Dad! Is it via Telogo Pekerti, sir? - Telogo Pekerti? - Yes. I never heard of it, sir. - Is it residential, sir? - No. It's a kind of mountain. A hill, to be exact. Hill... A limestone hill. I never knew there was a limestone hill here, sir. I'm sure about it. The last time I came was in 1968. The location is clearly there. Does anyone know where Telogo Pekerti is? Telogo Pekerti... I don't know, sir. Maybe it has changed the name. It was 1968. Yes, maybe it has changed the name, sir. Thank you. Okay, sir. - Thank you, sir. - Yes. Where are we actually going? We have changed public transportation four times and passed this place two times. How do you know? Look at that inn. We've been back and forth, Dad. I'd better take a break. As I recall, in 1981, the name has been changed, sir. If I'm not mistaken, they call it Bukit Emas. From Telogo Pekerti to Bukit Emas? The thing is many people have become rich from that limestone mines, sir. Ma'am, what should I take to go there? I want to arrive before sunset. How do I put this? The place is very secluded. Many narrow roads. It will be hard if you take public transportation. Moreover, arrive before sunset. Do you want to rent a car? Is there one? How much, ma'am? Why loitering around? Where are you going? People who are close to God... Well, always given directions. Why don't we take a break? Take it easy. It's already time to break fasting. Don't you want to eat? So is this called Bukit Emas? Destroying nature like this? How do you go up if it's like this? MINING AREA, DO NOT ENTER MINING AREA, DO NOT ENTER Peace be upon us. Peace be upon us. Let's perform taraweeh prayer together. May God have mercy on you. There's no god, but God. God is almighty. God is almighty. In the name of God, The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful. Hello, Halida? How's my passport? How is Dad? Is he okay? He's okay. How's my passport? Is his business done? Well, I guess so. Even though he seems disappointed. Why is that? Yes, well, we found the place, but... It's a mess, Halida. And then? We'll be going home. What else can we do? Who said that? You have seen the place for yourself. There is another place. - But... - There is another place. So there's actually another place? Why didn't you tell me... Now, sleep and wake up early tomorrow. And tell your sister to call again tomorrow morning. Tell her that. Don't forget my passport, Halida. Remember our deal. Turn off the lights. Yes, hello? Heli, how is it? Is your passport ready? It's still in process. It can't be done right away. Right? There is a process... How long, Heli? I need the date, when is it? Immediately. I'm leaving when the passport is ready. You know, I'm also... Hello? Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. What's the matter, sir? Can I meet Mr. Sofyan? Mr. Sofyan has moved. In fact, it has been five years since I bought the house. May I know the new address, sir? Who are you to Mr. Sofyan? And what's your business to meet Mr. Sofyan? I'm his friend at an Islamic boarding school. There is something I want to discuss. Sorry, sir, may I know what you will discuss? I don't want to get into trouble if something happens to Mr. Sofyan. It's hard to explain, sir. God willing, I will not bring any trouble to Mr. Sofyan. For God's sake, sir. I am a good person. I just want to meet him. I'm a close friend. Wait a minute. So you actually don't know where we are going? When did I say that to you? What... Since yesterday, you've been talking as if you really knew where we're going. If only I knew. It's not possible for us to travel for one or two days, Dad. I don't have time. Then why are you following me? I never forced you. If you bring your own car, the trip will take about two hours, sir. But if you use public transportation, maybe four hours. Here's the address. Glory be to God. Thank you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. What if the address is wrong again? We're just wasting our time. If your every step is only for God, nothing is wasted. Why do you have to complicate life like this, Dad? Technology already exists, and there are many experts. If it's fast for us to see hilal, why do you make it so long? I've always been like this. Now, let me ask. Does devotion mean you always have to make your life harder? Do you mean life is just about hard and easy? Is that so? Move! Dad is being stubborn, Halida. You go tell him, Halida. He wouldn't listen to me. - You should obey Dad, Hel. - He's being difficult. - That's your job there. - I have another business. - My time is... - If you can't bring Dad home, - Wait... - don't expect you'll leave this country. - Please listen. - I can blacklist your passport. - I just... - Do you get it? Damn it. Hello? Heli, are you really serious? - Listen, Shin... - Apparently, they were right. You are really unreliable. Heli, I can't keep on defending you, if until now, you've been uncertain. Can I speak for a second? Hel, sorry. I have to call someone else. No, please don't. Heli, I can't if everything is uncertain like this. Then listen to me. Our friends are feeling restless, Hel. It's not just for you. It's for Nicaragua. Anyway, I'll call you... Sorry. LET'S GUIDE OUR CHILDREN WISELY TO PROSPER THE MOSQUE MAWAR MERAH STREET Peace be upon you. Is this the place? If only you had told me the address since yesterday, we don't need to loitering around since the place is wrong. But the place is right. But the result... Indeed, God has intended the process to be like that. God also allowed this technology to exist, right, Dad? Now, it's up to humans to use the technology or not. Wait. Okay. Are you sure you can find the location on your own? God willing. Okay. When the location has been found, but it's too late, Eid has come, then what? Or the location has been found, but God forbid, Dad, the person is dead. Or he had a stroke? Or... - Hey, don't go ahead of God. - What then? I said if... If that happens, what do you want? Do you want to keep going? Look at it, Dad. Based on this, to get to the location is only 30 minutes. If we're using public transportation, it only takes an hour at most. MAWAR MERAH STREET The person moved long ago, sir. Do you want to collect debt too? You are one year late. You have done your best, right? The address is also correct. Now, like it or not, we're going home. Look, the tea is waving to me. - What? Dad? - Break the fast first. We still have time to go to the terminal while it's not dark. I want to stay here! There is also tea in the terminal. - This is the atmosphere in the village. - Yes. Towards breaking the fast, people... - Yes. - gather like this. Harmonious, sir. Excuse me. Earlier, where did you want to go? I'm looking for a friend's address, but I haven't found it, sir. If we may ask, what is the address, sir? I happened to have it with me. Here's the address. Well, this one... It's indeed the same address, but the name of the district is different, sir. From here, it's still an hour and a half, sir. You got lost, sir. Goodness. Is this a scam or lost? What do you mean, sir? Well, thank you. Wait... Wait a minute, I remember you. Mr. Mahmud? Well, I remember. - Jun... - Junaedi, sir! - Gosh, Junaedi! - Junaedi. God has willed it. Sorry, he's my friend at an Islamic boarding school. That's right. Rather than going to Sofyan's place, Arifin's place is closer. Is it the same, sir? It's up to you, Jun. I just obey. Meeting Mr. Arifin is calming me down. It can't be denied that Mr. Arifin, until now, is surely fighting for his people. Right, Jun? About that... By the way, Mr. Mahmud, why did you get lost? This is all God's will. But you don't need to get lost, sir. You can ask your son. You can use Google Maps. Technology has advanced, how can you get lost? Everything depends on the intention. If technology has advanced, but the moral is zero, it's no difference. It's not going anywhere. WISH YOU ALL A HAPPY FASTING EID AL-FITR Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. Glory be to God! Mahmud! Mr. Arifin. - How many years have we not met? - Yes, right. - Gosh... - You're getting healthier. Yes, praise be to God. This is my son. - Peace be upon you. - You too. Come on, please. Please come in. - Yes. - Mr. Mahmud, I'll take my leave. - What? - I'm leaving. Okay, right. Thank you, Jun. No worries. Well, Mud. Go back to your intentions. My generation was indeed the first and the last to go there. It's called Hiro Tower. Before finally, the carnival was moved to Telogo Pekerti. Mr. Arifin, can you take us to the location? If using my car, it only takes two hours from here. The problem is... Here is it, Mud. When we're going there, we have to go through Karang Madu district. And I have forbidden myself to set foot there. Even for an inch. I'm really hurt by the people there, Mud. The district was previously an underdeveloped area. The economy is lagging, not to mention the faith. We seek refuge with God. I was there taking care of a mosque. I teach the kids to recite Quran. I've also looked for infaq donors. Three years later, their economy is growing from that mosque. But well, the people there really don't know how to repay kindness. I ran for a regent. They didn't choose me, Mud. I seek forgiveness from God. So now Mr. Arifin is... What? I can't be a regent, is that what you mean? Then what? Be a trader like you? Is it? Gosh. Besides being poor, collecting money for Umrah is also difficult... Enough, sir. How about the hilal again? Well, Mud, just forget it, Mud. You are old. The carnival business is over. It's not over for me. I still need a flashback. So I can be able to rise to fight for the people. People? Who do you mean, Mud? Those shoppers of your store? What's the importance? When you think so highly, all they understand is that Eid is wearing new clothes. The main thing is... life is just buying and selling. If your life wants to keep going, don't overturn a trade that doesn't sell. I think you are wrong. The struggle for change is not for people who are afraid of losing, sir. So... if you don't have the guts anymore to do big, please don't invite my dad to be a loser like you. What? Say that again! Try me! Sir, enough, I'll excuse myself. I'm sorry. He says it's for the sake of the people, in the end, for the sakeof self-power lust. The deeds depend on the intention. What does it mean? I don't know. Don't think about it. This time, you're not lying, right? No, Dad. So earlier that day, you're lying. The thing is... about... That's your business with God. It's useless for you to justify yourself to me. Your sins have been recorded. I don't get any signal. I only got ads, but... no service. All you can do is buy and buy. Blame others. Right. You never think that's actually... every matter is determined by God. I'm a consumer. It's my right to complain. It's up to me. Do you have a way out? Well, ask someone who knows the location. Gosh, let's just ask someone around here tomorrow. I think... it's better if we directly ask the subdistrict office. I think if we start from there... You don't even listen. Peace be upon you. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Do you know any subdistrict office around here? It's still a long way off, sir. You need to use public transportation to that direction. What's the matter, sir? What's your deal to go to the office? Isn't it too early? Have you heard about Hiro Tower? What place is that, sir? Do you know any people around here who know about the village's history? It's hard to find, sir. But maybe Mr. Daniel knows. I happen to go to somewhere. I'll meet him there. Do you want me to take you? - Okay. - All right. - Right now? - Yes. Here, take this car. - This one? - Yes Okay, sir. Yes, please. "Dear God. We are still living in this world, waiting for Jesus to come back. Therefore, please teach us your laws. Open the eyes of our hearts, O Lord. So that we look forward to our whole lives on happiness. Peace, prosperity, and eternal life which thou hast promised..." We don't have time anymore. Why must it be thrown away here? We'd better wait than loitering around. "...that we may remain faithful and hopeful in your word... until the end of our life... and until Jesus comes later." - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! This worship is not legally valid! I ask all of you to disperse now! - Dissolve! - Dissolve! Please forgive us. If we are forbidden to pray in our own house, then where should we pray? That's none of my business. We just want to enforce the law. Your church permit was denied because the people around here disapproved of your worship! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - Dissolve! - Dissolve! Now, you guys are singing instead and preaching here. This hurts the people's hearts. It's against the law! Better now, you and everyone here, disperse now! - Dissolve! - Dissolve! - Let's disband! - Disperse! Whose law? Arrogant law like you? This worship is their right! - Who are you? - Wait for them to finish! So you have the balls for breaking the law? - Disperse! - Disperse! - Dissolve! - Dissolve! Disperse, I said! Dissolve! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! - God is almighty! Mr. Mahmud! Come here. Sir, Mr. Heli's dad. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Come on, Mr. Ustadz. Please sit down. How's Hel? - I'll take my leave. - Okay. - Take care. - Okay. Heli's wound isn't that bad, sir. Just a little bruise on the leg, then maybe he hit his head, but I have treated his legs. God willing, he'll get well soon. Please drink the tea while still warm, sir. Sorry, I'm fasting, sir. I seek forgiveness from God. I'm sorry, Mr. Ustadz. Sorry. So you're not fasting? I'm fasting, Mr. Ustadz, God willing. But earlier, I thought with a long journey, maybe Mr. Ustadz didn't fast. It's okay, I'll give the tea later for Heli. Earlier, Andi brought Heli here, sir. Andi who is a Christian? - He is my nephew, sir. - Wait... Aren't you... Our family is a mess, sir. Mixed. Hey, are you feeling better now, Heli? Yes, I'm feeling better, sir. Thank you. I'm sorry to hear that you became a victim. Actually, a riot in this village just happened recently, Mr. Ustadz, Heli. It used to be safe, peaceful. Almost no problem. Initially, there were only some Christians around here. Just some families. The number increases only by birth. This is what makes the number of families increase. Then what's the problem now? It's about the permit, Heli. But with the residents have already been exposed to all kinds of issues, sensitive issues, so... they are afraid to give the permit. Fear of apostasy, Mr. Ustadz. Who spreads the Christianization issue? If that's the case, I don't know, Heli. So it's not just a matter of permit? Well, at first, it was a trivial matter, Mr. Ustadz. About parking. Every time, the number of congregations is increasing, with many other villagers also praying here. Like my nephew, Andi. Well, with so many congregations, then the parking is disorganized, sir. The church parking lot is too small, spilling out to the street and to citizens' yards. Isn't there any admonition from the neighborhood to the church? That's where the problem is getting more complicated, Mr. Ustadz. Suddenly, the neighborhood associate asked for help from mass organizations in other regions to admonish the church. Maybe Mr. Associate thinks that's the best solution. So the people who have been buzzing all this time are not residents here? Yes, at first, we just wanted to admonish them with parking problems. Well, now what happened is we are ashamed and sad to see our residents, our people, unable to worship. I believe Islam is a religion that is full of love. If I may ask, in a situation like this, does Islam have an answer that doesn't hurt anyone? Dad, I know we only have a little time. Mr. Majid, if possible, I would like to help solve this question. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. I ask forgiveness from God the Almighty. What are you guys doing here again? Want to make a fuss again? Go away. What if we could give you the votes of one village? Glory be to God. Actually, when you two were gone, my heart really missed you. Come on. Throughout our 30-minute journey of dialogue, listening to your critiques, your complaints, I really feel so grateful for us to be able to talk tonight. Yes, I, as representative of the congregation, was at fault. For all this time, being insensitive to the parking problems and scattered rubbish caused by our congregation. I also need suggestions about... Wait a minute. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Daniel. We actually have that spacious soccer field. - Right? - That's right. We can use it as a parking lot. How about the security, sir? - That's... - Don't worry, Mr. Daniel. We have youths to protect them. We can collect the parking fee for income to the youth organization. Also, to hold village events, right? - Don't you agree? - Yes. One more thing, Mr. Associate. Please forgive me for saying this. It might interrupt our happiness tonight. About the mass organizations. How is that? Who among us will come later and tell them not to come to our village again, sir? That's why Mr. Arifin is here with us tonight. He is a community figure. It is certain that he has direct access to the government. Is that right, sir? Yes, that's right. I'll take care of the permit and I will arrange the affairs of these mass organizations. What's important is all of you can live in peace, okay? - Right. - Right. - Praise be to God. - Praise be to God. And this is if you can, sir, actually, we can set up food stalls around the field. Of course! Don't worry, Mr. Daniel. That's the job for the women organization. For the women organization or Mrs. Associate? Of course not. But if it's the job for Mrs. Associate, it's okay. That'll increase my income. The goal is when people want to eat there, we have the place. - Well... - Okay. You eat a lot, right? It's just what you want, right? Well, here it is. I hope the picture is clear. Yes. This is the tower. So this used to be Holland Tower, but then it was taken by the Japanese. And during the Japanese era, the tower was changed to Hiro Tower. The location is close to the beach. The village is Samar Village. Here, take this. Gosh... Glory be to God. Now, this. Hopefully, it can help your journey. We can directly go there tomorrow morning, Dad. No need to wait for the bus. Mr. Daniel, thank you. You're welcome. Mr. Daniel. Are you sleepy, Dad? Take a rest there. I want to pray duha. FARMER'S HUT God is Almighty. God is Almighty. You didn't wake me up, Dad. You're sleeping so soundly. You should still wake me up, Dad. It's too late, we have to go. In the name of God. Are you okay, Dad? Well? My feet are tingling. Sir, could you please check my motorbike? Okay, wait a second, sir. It doesn't seem strong when going uphill. Is this a motorbike or a craft, sir? - Why? - It's crushed. It's complicated. How long do you need to fix it? The spare part is rare. We have to go to town. In Eid times like this, not all the store is open, sir. Just leave it overnight, okay? The condition is bad. I actually just need to go to this location. Okay, wait a minute. - Min! - Yes? - Are you going to Samar Village? - Yes. Let them join you. Well, come on. - There. - How about this? We can do it later. Let me fix this. You just need to follow him. God is Almighty. God is Almighty. God is Almighty. God is Almighty. - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! -There's no god, but God -There's no god, but God - for God is Almighty! - for God is Almighty! Thank you, sir. I seek forgiveness from God. It's not Eid yet. - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! -There's no god, but God -There's no god, but God - for God is Almighty! - for God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - Praise be for God! - Praise be for God! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! -There's no god, but God -There's no god, but God - for God is Almighty! - for God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! -There's no god, but God -There's no god, but God - for God is Almighty! - for God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - God is Almighty! - Praise be for God! - Praise be for God! Ladies and gentlemen, please. The host's job is to make the guests full, Heli. Moreover, on the night of kenduri takbir like this. Then the guest's duty is to eat the food. - Come on, please. - Please. - Please eat. - Let's be blessed. Let's be safe. Let the luck run smoothly. It's already been prayed for. - Come on, please. - Please. Since when practices like this can determine your safety, sir? Our practice has good intentions, sir. This is what our teachers taught before. This tradition is to realize Islamic values. That's right, sir. Well, this red jenang is reminding us to always be brave to defend religion. So far, I have never used jenang, but I still can defend religion. What you have been doing all this time is not Islamic. It is not recommended in our religion. And when you make something obligatory while it's not obligatory, that's the risk of heresy. Wait, is it that easy to accuse of heresy, sir? Only knowledgeable people should be able to say that. Since I entered this village, there's still a lot that needs to be straightened out, sir. For example, how did you know that tomorrow will be Eid? It's because of Eid last year fall on Saturday pahing. So if you look forward to 360 days, it will fall exactly tomorrow morning. That's the Javanese calendar. The Javanese calendar is the same as the Hijri calendar, sir. It's just the same. We do use Hisab Munjib, sir. Yes, but you have to use Hisab Rukyat, sir. The main thing is hilal. And this has been agreed upon by the Ulil Amri. Indeed, sir. In the past, in this place, there were also residents who celebrated Eid using Hilal Rukyat. They used to wait every time for Eid, always at Hiro Tower there. So that's what I wanted to ask. Where is it located? That's another 4 km to the north. But you'll have to walk because the road is not paved. It's been a long time since anyone visited. Okay, fine, 4 km to the north. Then we'll excuse ourselves... Wait a minute, Heli. Let me convey the truth of God. What's the truth, Dad? Whose version of the truth are we discussing? Quran, Sunna, and the truth of God. Everyone feels the most understanding about God's truth, Dad. Everyone feels that they can correct others. Including the people we met yesterday. An Ustadz who deceived the people. People who try to ban others from worship. Enough! If you don't understand religion, don't talk much. I do not understand why God made us different. For what? So that we kill each other? Why not make us the same? Did God just do this for fun? You godless! Why? Because I have a lot of questions? I ask a lot of questions so that I understand, Dad. Not just against you. Are you sure what you believe is not wrong? Go away! You are not my child anymore. For the sake of da'wah, you left Mother while she was sick. I also, if I have a choice, I don't want a dad like you. Indeed, you know the most about religion, but you don't know how to be a good dad. Excuse me. For you, sir. - Thank you. - Yes. Please read this book, sir. Maybe if your understanding is not fragmentary, - your perspective will also change. - Yes. Our talk must be outspoken. Right. It's up to you to accept it or not. This book... I'll take it. - Please. Please take it. - Please. It doesn't matter. I'm sorry, son. It's up to you. I'll obey. Sincerely, Dad? Then we look for hilal. In the name of God... Heli... Hilal. Hilal, son. I believe it, Dad. WE SURELY BELONG TO ALLAH AND TO HIM WE SHALL RETURN WE SURELY BELONG TO ALLAH AND TO HIM WE SHALL RETURN
